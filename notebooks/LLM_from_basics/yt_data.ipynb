      " Everyone would like to have a portfolio of companies that we can hold forever. That's the ideal investment, a company that you can buy into one time in your life and watch it grow forever and ever. I consider myself a buy and hold investor, and in my portfolio I'm always looking for companies that I could potentially hold for the rest of my life. After all, holding companies for a long period of time is exactly what we've been instructed to do by the best investors alive. Warren Buffett has famously said that our favorite holding period is forever. Peter Lynch, one of the best stock pickers to ever live, said you only need one or two good stocks a decade. You don't need a lot of action. Now with my stocks, I'm trying to do the same thing, buying companies that I can potentially hold my entire life. But it seems like over time, this is getting more difficult, especially in 2024. The buy and hold strategy is becoming more and more difficult as companies come and go. And part of the reason why this is becoming increasingly challenging is because companies themselves are having shorter and shorter lifespans. And this problem of shortening lifespan of companies is probably worse than you imagine. A recent study by McKinsey found that the average lifespan of companies listed in the S&P 500 was 61 years in 1958. Today, it's less than 18 years. McKinsey notes that most of these companies end up disappearing in the S&P 500 over a decade's time because they're either bought out, they're merged, or they'll go bankrupt like Enron and Lehman Brothers. With companies living less long than ever and going out of the S&P 500 instead of in 61 years, now in only 18, it makes sense that the average U.S. equity holding period has also declined rapidly over the past 20 years. Back in 1977, investors held stocks on average for 5 years. Now today, investors hold on average for only 10 months. So if you're investing like me today, you face unique challenges. Of an index that's always turning over new holdings. There's always new companies to buy. There's always new relevant stories and different things to invest in. And this can become overwhelming and discouraging. In fact, many investors may just choose to index, believing that there's no way to hold individual stocks long term. But I don't believe investors should be discouraged. Even though this market brings us unique challenges, there's still many companies that will endure for decades. In this episode, I'll be going over examples of 5 different companies to buy and hold forever. And what makes these companies different than most others. So let's go ahead and jump in and we'll start off with stock number one. The number one stock to buy and hold forever is Microsoft. And I place this against the alternatives which are Apple and Google. Microsoft is a better buy and hold company forever than Google or Apple. And I'll explain why. When I'm looking at companies that I can potentially hold forever, one of the biggest challenges is understanding the long-term durability of their moat. Currently, Apple has a wide moat. The company's in a fantastic position. And their dominance in the iPhone is what's really created this ecosystem of moat surrounding this company. Now, Apple has also transitioned to a software company. We've seen that happen over time as they've grown their services. This is stuff like their Apple Care Insurance. But primarily, this comes down to the App Store. They funnel all of their major transactions on their device through the App Store, which they take a cut from. So we see the services growing over time. Now, Apple makes money through a lot of different software, but the biggest income for Apple is their hardware. And historically, hardware sellers like Apple have not had long-term durability. There's not many that have existed for 40 or 50 or 60 years, continually selling the best hardware that exists. Apple's done a fantastic job now, but hardware companies have a history of disruption. Companies like Apple have come and gone before. Companies that have kept the lead for a couple decades, then they got beat out on the next transitional technology. Meta is wanting to create the next tech platform with their Meta glasses, with their goggles, with their Ray-Ban glasses. They are doing everything they can to take the mantle from Apple. And although it seems very unlikely that that will happen today, this type of thing can possibly happen in the future. Hardware trends can change. And if Apple doesn't make the right investments, they could be disrupted. The other alternative I looked at here is Google as a potential lifelong hold. I really like Google. I think the company's at a low valuation, and I think it has a very bright future. But when trying to contrast it with Microsoft, Google doesn't hold up. Google's revenue and operating income is highly concentrated into advertising, specifically in their search products. This high level of concentration is good when they're able to protect their business, but it does leave ongoing challenge of Google constantly innovating and staying at the top of the trends. The biggest thing I like about Google right now is the cloud business growing over time, but that is a small portion of the overall business. Google is a wonderful business, but it's just not as long-term predictable as Microsoft. Microsoft is the essence of durability. The stock has three equally sized revenue paths, all of which have very high margins. The productivity and business software is highly integrated into the S&P 500, Fortune 500 companies. Virtually every single company works hand-in-hand with Microsoft. Trying to surpass products like Excel is nearly impossible at this point. Then you have the intelligence cloud. Microsoft's cloud business is much bigger than Google's, and it's growing very fast. Their intelligence cloud brings a lot of predictability to the company. And then Microsoft does have a portion in personal computing and hardware, but that's at a much smaller ratio than Apple. The majority of Microsoft's revenue comes from subscription billing or long-term contracts, highly reoccurring revenue with baked-in price increases, making Microsoft overall one of the most predictable revenue-growing companies in the world. And while their revenue is diversified by different products, it's also diversified geographically. The company is all over the world. They get half their revenue outside of the US. It's not just the US that's reliant on Microsoft, it's the entire globe. Microsoft is great at fighting off competitors. They've proven their moat over and over again with almost ease. If we look at the gross margins of the business, one of the things they focus on is keeping them right at 70%. And they've basically done that for the entire past 10 years. Their gross margins rarely ever dip below 70%. With 80% of the revenue being reoccurring or subscription-based, with the big majority of products being in secular growth trends and critically important to companies, I consider Microsoft a lifelong hold. For that reason, Microsoft has become one of the bigger companies in my portfolio. It's a big winner today. And even though it has a lofty valuation, I don't plan on selling. Now, the second buy-and-hold stock is one that you may have guessed. It's Costco. When looking at Costco, I think it's important to compare the relative business models between this one and good alternatives like Walmart or Target. Walmart and Target are two excellent companies, but they have some key differences between those business models and Costco. One of the key questions that you ask yourself when looking at a company that you could truly buy and hold forever is how easy is it for them to defend their business model. And the business model of Costco, I believe, is one of the easiest ones to defend. Costco is not a seller of goods. That's not the way that they view their business model. They view themselves as a buying agent on behalf of their customers. Their goal and mission is to get their customers the lowest prices possible. Their goal is to have the overall lowest margins in the industry and share the economics not with the investors, but with the customers. With Costco's business model of having a membership and selling bulk items, they can still dish out a lot of free cash flow while offering consumers the lowest margins on their purchases. Consumers get the best deal on a per-dollar basis of what they're buying while Costco still makes money. And without the pure membership model, Walmart and Target can't possibly replicate this business model. Companies like Target and Walmart rely primarily on the margin of their sales to make their money. So when sales start to go down, margins get tight, the company has huge fluctuations in cash flow. Fortunately for Costco, they don't have to worry about that. Even though the sales make up the huge majority of revenue, the profits mostly come from the membership. This membership revenue smooths out the inherent volatility of the retail business. So even though Walmart and Target are both excellent companies and great competitors, Costco still stands as a uniquely positioned company to hold for a lifetime. The number three buy and hold stock forever is Berkshire. Berkshire Hathaway is so different than other companies that I really couldn't think of a comparable company. For a company to be buy and hold, it needs to be virtually indestructible. And the fortress that Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have architected is certainly in that category. There's no realistic way to destroy Berkshire Hathaway. In the last trailing 12 months, Berkshire did $370 billion in revenue. And that revenue is also highly diversified, maybe more so than any other business in existence. Berkshire owns dozens of subsidiaries. These are wholly owned companies. And logistics, materials, and food, and real estate, and clothing, insurance companies, furniture companies, jet rental companies, natural gas companies. Berkshire has a massive energy business. And they also own one-off companies like Seize Candy that are highly profitable. These one-off companies have returned billions to Berkshire over the years. Their wholly owned subsidiaries are constant operating cash flow generating machines. But then they also have significant investments in publicly traded equities. They own Ally Financial and Amazon and American Express, Apple, Bank of America, and so on and so forth. Berkshire has built up a sizable publicly traded portfolio. Between the two, Berkshire has growing operating income and generates billions of dollars of free cash flow that are continually reinvested back into the business or put into their large storehouse of cash. Berkshire's cash pile is also absurd. It was at a very high level before last quarter when they had $188 billion of cash. Having nearly $200 billion of cash in and of itself is crazy for any single company. This cash pile alone has a bigger market cap than the majority of companies in the S&P 500. But then Berkshire took gains in Apple. They sold off roughly half their Apple stock and their cash pile went to $276 billion. And between that and their operating income constantly flowing into cash means that Berkshire is getting closer to $300 billion in cash. That's more cash than the U.S. Federal Reserve has on their balance sheet. Between the diverse and reliable forms of revenue and a balance sheet that's worth nearly $300 billion, Berkshire is an indestructible company. The only real risk to Berkshire's future is the management. And even with improper management, this company is still likely to survive for a lifetime. In number four, we have three companies that have dominant market share and are de facto monopolies. FICO, ASML, and S&P Global. But out of the three, the best long-term hold is S&P Global. Now don't get me wrong. FICO and ASML are incredibly good companies. And I believe they have very bright futures. I think investors will continue to do well in these companies. So we have no bad companies in this mix. But when I assess FICO compared against S&P Global, I do see some notable differences in their business model. One of which is that FICO has relied on their revenue growth and profit growth, primarily on aggressive price increases. And this is something that brings a lot of scrutiny. When a company is raising their prices way above the rate of inflation, at rates of 50 or even 100% per year, especially when they have a dominant market position, that brings scrutiny to the company's practices. Josh Howley and other senators are turning their attention to FICO's competitive advantages, alleging that FICO is harming consumers by pushing across these price increases as a monopoly. Now nothing's really happened since that letter, and maybe the Senate won't investigate it. But either way, over time, it's not good for a company to make money by doing aggressive price increases that come at the odds of their customers. Price increases are expected and fine in any business, but when they're done to the level that FICO has, it's going to draw a lot of negative attention and scrutiny. FICO's also taken the capital allocation approach of taking out a lot of cheap debt to buy back their stock. And of course, that was a very profitable trade, if you're an investor two years ago in the stock. But that leaves them in a situation where they have a weakened balance sheet and a lot of interest payments to pay on top of their operating expenses. And the last consideration is that FICO is mostly used within the U.S. Although it does have some international application, so although it's a monopoly within the U.S., it does not have the same pricing power outside of the U.S. ASML is another top company that I considered for a buy and hold forever portfolio. The company makes incredibly complex technology. It has a dominant moat. Lithography is used in the creation of every major chip. And there's a few big semi-companies that rely on ASML's technology. So they've carved out a nice position for themselves. The big risk in the long-term durability of ASML is the complexity in running the business. ASML requires some of the most smart people in the world to run this company, and even smarter people to make adaptations and innovate on new technology. Any company that requires this level of expertise to run and advance also runs the risk of their talent being stolen by would-be competitors. When we compare either of these to S&P Global, even though S&P Global may not grow quite as fast, and it may not have quite as much pricing power, the company does have a lot of long-term durable characteristics. First of all, the diversification of revenue. With every company that we're looking at that has the potential of being a buy and hold company, we want ones that have extremely durable and reliable, predictable revenue. S&P Global has that with their different revenue lines. In particular, their rating business and their indices business. Out of all the lines of business, these two forms of revenue are virtually indestructible. The ratings business, much like FICO, is a credit rating, but not for individuals, it's for entire companies. Unlike FICO, the ratings business for S&P Global is a global ratings business. It is just as popular outside of the US as it is within the US. Those type of common language network effects are incredibly difficult to disrupt. Another virtually indestructible portion of this company is the indices. S&P Global owns the Dow Jones, which has the S&P 500. So as long as you think the S&P 500 will be the primary benchmark, S&P Global has a continually growing licensed revenue based off of those indices. And even outside of the ratings and the indices, the other forms of their business are also not bad at all. And the market intelligence business certainly does face competition. But even so, the market intelligence is a high margin, highly profitable business with long-term secular growth trends. With S&P Global owning the most popular indices in the world, having a toll booth on the rating of global debt, and being in the business of selling unique data to customers on a repeat basis, it's very unlikely to see this company disrupted over the next 30 years. The number five buy and hold stock is between Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, the big digital payment networks. Of these three, I've selected Visa as the most likely to be a buy and hold forever. While all three of these companies will likely exist for a lifetime, Visa is the most unlikely to be disrupted. And that is because on a pure network basis, Visa is the largest. The scale of their network is almost incomprehensible. While it's true that Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are continually looked at by the government, and the government is always trying to impose more strict regulations and better prices for merchants, it's also true that these companies have simply reached too critical of a scale. The scale that they operate in the U.S. is too large to be completely shut down by the government. And frankly, when it comes right down to it, people like their credit cards and their debit cards. People like debit card rewards. They like credit card rewards. Once a customer has a credit card and they start earning rewards in their bank, those credit card rewards become part of their life. So the thought of that ever being taken away from the American consumer is incredibly unlikely. MasterCard and American Express are formidable competitors to Visa, and they have some variance in their business model. American Express operates more as a fully-fledged bank, an entire ecosystem, and while that's a very good business model, it's arguably more competitive than what Visa is doing. MasterCard is growing quickly, especially internationally, but Visa owns the biggest market share within the U.S. New payment methods will come and go. There'll be new innovations in this space, and that may frighten investors from Visa from time to time. But customers will want their credit card rewards, and banks will want to issue credit cards as well. That combination should sustain Visa's growth for at least the next 20 years. So overall, these are the five companies that I consider to have nearly unbreakable modes. The duration of the stocks are very long. The likelihood of them ever being disrupted is incredibly low. They're certainly ones worth considering adding to the portfolio and never looking back. But that's all for this time. Hope you enjoyed, and I'll see you in the next one.\n",

      " Everyone would love to have a monster dividend portfolio, one that spits out huge dividends day after day, thousands and thousands of dollars. A portfolio of businesses that produces so much income every single week, every month, that you can live off of it. It completely subsidizes and replaces your active income. Dividends, after all, are passive income. It's money that you make without having to lift a finger. You have to do the initial upfront work. You have to buy the investment. But once you've done that, you're set. You earn passive income via dividend. This is not only what my entire portfolio centered around, but it's also my ultimate goal, to get to the point where I'm no longer reliant on active work, where working is an opportunity. It's a choice. It's not a requirement. That is the goal of passive income. Now, I've been building this portfolio publicly for some time. I do it under public scrutiny. You can see the changes that I make. You can see the buys that I do, and you can see the sales that I make. But in this episode, I'd like to do something a bit different than show you just the most recent trades I'm making. I'd rather show you the lessons that I've learned in building a monster dividend portfolio over the past four years. I want to go over what I think are the biggest mistakes that dividend investors are making, what I think are the biggest things they should be focusing on, and how I believe investors today can get to their goals as fast as possible. So this is going to be a good one. We're going to be going over five years of investing and summarizing my best lessons in this episode. Now, of course, we have some other news to get to as well. Mark Zuckerberg is on the move. Meta has released their initial plans to compete with Twitter. So Meta is doing what they do historically, which is copy other social media competitors, and they do this very effectively. I'll be giving you my opinion on this Twitter copycat. And on the subject of Meta and Mark Zuckerberg, we get to see in detail what Mark Zuckerberg's initial response was of the Vision Pro. I have a lot of thoughts on this, so we'll be going into this as well. And then it's Friday, the day where we turn to TikTok to get the best tips on finance and investing. And this tip is specifically on house hacking. This is the all-time best house hacking hack ever. So we'll be looking at this, and I'll be giving my reaction here at the end of this episode. So as always, if you like this type of content, if you like the transparency we have here, make sure to thumbs up the video, subscribe to the channel. Now let's go ahead and jump right in. First of all, we'll start off with building a monster dividend portfolio. This is something that I've been trying to work on for five years now. I've been focusing my portfolio around building up passive income. That's remained the ultimate end goal of this portfolio. And while doing that over the past five years and having the opportunity to run a YouTube channel and spending an incredible amount of time studying investing, I've been able to see a lot of things that work and a lot of things that don't work when trying to do this. So what I hope to do is basically share everything that I've learned along the way. And I wanna start off with the basics. When we're building a monster dividend portfolio, there's three basic ways that this works, three basic ways that it compounds. And I've gone over this in previous videos, so I'll just go over it briefly. First of all, we buy into companies that pay a dividend. This is the first way that we grow a dividend portfolio. And along with number one here, I would say that an important step is having a consistent income to begin with. You can't leap over to passive income without having an active income. So you need to have a stable job, you need to have a stable income, and you need to have your budgeting down so that you have money every single week to add to your portfolio. But once you have that money, you need to start putting it to work. And put it to work as soon and as frequent as you can. Step one, buy companies that pay a dividend that pays you the initial dividend yield. The initial dividend yield is what gets the ball rolling. You have money flowing into your account. For example, in this portfolio, I've earned a total of $21,594 in dividends. These have been growing the entire time that I've been investing. This number always goes up. It never goes down. Companies are always paying me dividends. Step two is pretty basic. We reinvest the dividend. Once a company pays you out cash flow, use it to buy other companies that you consider to be high return opportunities. So as you have money flowing in, every single week and every month in dividend payments, look through your portfolio and see which ones are offering the best opportunity at a given time. My way of doing this is I use something called the Dip Finder. It's a tool that I've built where it basically just shows which companies are in a dip at a given time. I can select different time metrics here like last month and I can see which companies are doing really well and which companies are struggling a bit. These are all of my core holdings. So when I select the last month, I can see right here that Canadian Pacific, MasterCard, and Vici are in the red. They've gone down over the past 30 days. S&P Global, on the other hand, has gone on a pretty good run. Microsoft is doing great. Apple's doing great. Costco's doing good. Texas Roadhouse is doing good. So these companies that are up a lot over the past 30 days, I'm gonna avoid. I'll just let them continue to run and then I'll buy the companies that I think are really good that have gone down in value. And guess what? Just a couple days ago, I bought more Vici. I bought more because it's trading down and I think it offers great value. This is me following number two, taking the dividends that I'm paid and reinvesting it into the best high return opportunity. Then we have number three, the company growing the dividend over time. So this changes the criteria in which we choose companies to invest in. We don't only want companies that pay a dividend, we want companies that pay a growing dividend. And by growing, I mean growing beyond the rate of inflation. We can take Verizon as a counterexample here. This company does pay a dividend and the dividend is technically growing. It's been growing by 2.39%. But unfortunately, inflation has been above 2.39%. Even if we were really charitable and said that inflation was only 2%, this dividend is flat. It's really not growing at all. The dividend payment adjusted for inflation is the exact same today that it was a decade ago. So while Verizon pays a dividend, it does not pay a growing dividend. On the other hand, every single company within my portfolio, every one of them pays not only a steady dividend, they pay a growing dividend. I can take S&P Global for example. S&P Global pays a consistent growing dividend and it has done so for years. And the dividend is growing far above the rate of inflation at 12%. MasterCard pays a very consistent dividend and it's growing at a very rapid rate, 25% per year. And like I said, this is the same for every company. Intuit, Apple, Microsoft, Vici, Texas Roadhouse, Costco, so on and so forth. All of them pay consistent and growing dividends. And that's step three. And these are the three basic steps of building a monster dividend portfolio. You buy companies that pay a dividend, you reinvest that money from the dividends back into companies that pay dividends and it grows your dividend income. And then importantly, you try to focus on companies that not only pay a consistent dividend, but they pay a growing dividend far above the rate of inflation. All of these three together are really powerful. The compounding effect they have is almost magical. In fact, I'm reading this book that's an in-depth study on Buffett's life called The Snowball. And it extensively goes through his entire history. And one of the things it points out is that he's basically a dividend growth investor. Throughout his entire life, especially his early life, he was always accumulating stakes in companies that paid him excess cashflow. Buffett used that excess cashflow to buy more companies that paid growing amounts of excess cashflow. That is literally the snowball. It's Buffett's investing strategy. The reason that Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend is because Buffett is playing the role of the investor reinvesting the cash flows. But otherwise, he's running the company in the exact same way as a dividend growth investor. Buying good companies that pay excess cash, reinvesting that cash to buy more companies, and focusing on companies that can really grow that cash pile over time. The magical effect of this is a strong compounding snowball effect. Now that seems simple enough, but even given those instructions, what I notice is a lot of dividend investors make some very critical errors. And that's where I wanna go over where dividend investors are failing, where they're falling short. And when I give these critiques, a lot of these criticisms are basically criticizing myself five years ago. I was making a lot of these same mistakes that I've since corrected. So let me go ahead and go through them. The first thing that I'd say that dividend investors make a mistake on is the focus on starting yield. The starting yield is what the company's yield is right now, today. That is the main focus of a lot of dividend investors. They seek companies that will instantly give them a high starting yield. And a lot of companies that have a high starting yield are not the best companies. We can look at a lot of different examples here. We can look at Verizon again as an example of this. This is a company that lures investors in with a very high starting dividend yield, a yield of 7.31%. So you may look at this and think, wow, I buy $100 of this and I get $7.31 back every single year. That's pretty good. That's a much higher yield than a company like MasterCard. So Verizon is the better bet. I'm getting more cashflow through owning this company. The temptation to buy into companies with these very hefty starting yields without looking at the fundamental drivers of the company leads to lots of underperformance. Verizon has been a horrible company to own, going down 28% over the past five years. In the past 10 years, even with dividends, this company's basically given no returns. So that 7% juicy starting yield you're getting has given you absolutely no returns over the past 10 years as the rest of the market has raced up. And why is that? Well, for one, Verizon really hasn't grown revenue that much in the past 10 years. Their cash flows look very similar over the past 20 years. They've been diluting shareholders as well to finance their operations. And they have a breathtaking amount of debt. The amount of debt is literally over $100 billion. So this giant telecom company that's luring investors in is really nothing more than a value trap. The company has caught investors and kept them there in a company that's producing zero returns over extended periods of time. And this isn't the only one to do this. We have investments like AT&T. This is one investment that I was in. I barely eked out a return on this company by simply luckily timing the buy and sell of it. But overall, AT&T was not an attractive investment. What really lured me into AT&T was the same thing that lured many other investors into this company. The starting dividend yield of nearly 7%. The high, very high starting yield that was so, it's just so tempting to buy into companies where you think you're gonna get paid back that much every single year. What it really turns out to be where you're waiting around, hoping that the company will at least maintain its value while it pays out this cash flow. In the case of Verizon and AT&T, the company's fundamentals are very poor. The competitive dynamics are very poor. The profitability, the balance sheet are very poor. And the investments as a result stumble. AT&T is down 41% over the past decade. And they recently just slashed their dividend to half of what it used to be, making it so that even the people that were in this company for the dividend are not getting their payday anymore. So the number one mistake here is crucial to avoid for every investor. Don't focus on the starting yield. If your major focus is finding companies with high starting yields, most of those companies are pathways. They're roads down to companies that are many cases value traps. In fact, I would argue that the higher the starting yield, the more likely the company is to become a value trap. It's not the case in every company. Some companies do have that magical mix of a high starting yield while still being an attractive growth company. But in most cases, high starting yields mean value traps. Ironically, one of the things that I get criticized the most on my channel is that I'm a dividend investor that focuses too much on companies with low starting yields. I recently bought into S&P Global. S&P Global only has a 0.95% starting yield. It's very low. This isn't any AT&T or Verizon. I also bought into MasterCard. MasterCard has even a lower starting yield, 0.61%. Now, not all companies that I buy have very low starting yields. Some of them are a bit higher. In the restaurant category, Texas Roadhouse was a company that I bought that at the time I was buying it had a 2.5% starting dividend yield. This one has a decent yield, but it's still no Verizon or AT&T. But either way, a lot of my companies have lower starting yields than most dividend investors. And this is done intentionally. The companies that I'm focusing on are not value traps. They're not companies that have flat, risky, or low growth dividends. They are companies that have the economic capability to grow their dividends at very rapid rates. While Texas Roadhouse only has a starting dividend yield of 2% that's nowhere close to Verizon or AT&T, it has something different than Verizon or AT&T. The dividend's growing, and it's growing at a very, very fast rate. Back in 2011, the dividend was only 8 pennies per share, 8 cents per share, and then the most recent dividend, 10 years later, is 55 cents per share. It's compounded at an annualized rate of 16.4% per year. So the dividend's four or five times bigger than it was a decade ago. Four or five times bigger. That means that the investors that bought 10 years ago now have a yield on cost of over 8%, higher than the Verizon or AT&T dividend. And while they've had that incredible dividend growth, four or five X-ing their dividend payment, they've also had massive capital appreciation, 347%. So investors in Texas Roadhouse are sitting much more pretty than the investors in Verizon or AT&T. The ones that were suckered in to the high starting yields have flat dividend payments or ones that are being cut, companies that haven't made any gains, and they overall have total returns that are negative. The investors that instead focused on companies that can grow their dividend payment have a dividend payment that's four or five times what it was 10 years ago, and gains in capital appreciation that are 350%. The evidence routinely favors companies that focus on dividend growth, not companies that focus on high starting yields. We can take MasterCard as another example. This is one that a lot of dividend investors will criticize for having a very low starting yield, only 0.61%. It seems insignificant at first look. But when you consider the actual growth of the dividend over time, it puts things into context. Back in 2011, the dividend payment was two pennies per share. Over the past five years, like Texas Roadhouse, they've been growing the dividend at around 18% per year. When you compound something, even at a low starting base at 20% per year, the growth is astronomical. That compounding turns a very low starting yield into a very high dividend payment in a short amount of time, going from two pennies to half a dollar in 10 years. What this reminds me of is the experiments with children of delayed gratification, whether they can wait a minute to get a marshmallow or two marshmallows a couple minutes later. The kids that were willing to delay gratification a little bit longer had overall better returns. I think as investors, we get tested in the same way. Are you really needing that high starting yield right now today? Or can you delay that gratification a little bit? Invest in very good companies that will 5X your dividend payment over the next 10 years, give you capital appreciation and a boosted amount of income at the same time. The way to judge if a company is able to pay you a growing dividend over the next decade is all about the financials of the company. If you use Qualtrum.com as an example to look at a company, we have Texas Roadhouse. How do I judge if Texas Roadhouse can pay me a growing dividend over time? Well, there's a couple important things I can look at. First of all is the growth profile of the company. We look at the revenue growth. Is the revenue growing on a consistent basis above the rate of inflation? In the case of Texas Roadhouse, that is a yes. And it's growing organically, not through acquisitions. So it's growing every single year, year over year at 12.56% without doing major acquisitions. The next thing that we look at is the free cashflow growth of the company. In the case of Texas Roadhouse, is this growing on a semi-consistent basis? Yes, it is. In fact, it's growing at a very fast speed, 15% over the past 10 years. The cash flows are the initial thing the company has to pay the dividend. So if the free cashflow is not growing and the dividend is growing, that just means that the company's paying you a higher percentage of their free cashflow. And eventually they cannot maintain that. They'll have to cut it like they did with Intel. Wild Texas Roadhouse is growing the free cashflow over time, leading to a fast growing dividend. Companies like Intel had cash flows that were shrinking. They were flat for a long period of time. Then they went down and so did the dividend. The dividend follows the cash flows. If the cash flows grow very fast, the dividend will grow fast. If the cash flows shrink, the dividend will shrink. So back to Texas Roadhouse, we look at the cash flows, we look at the net income growth, we look at the earnings per share growth. This is a good growth profile. It gives me confidence that this company has a long history. They have the recipe of growth. The management has been able to do this on a consistent basis. And aside from a lot of things you hear, past results in specific companies is oftentimes indicative of future results, especially if the same situation and environment exists. Nothing has really changed competitively in terms of Texas Roadhouse. So I expect similar levels of growth in the future. And then finally, the balance sheet is a huge indicator of a company's ability to pay future dividends. In the case of Texas Roadhouse, we can take a look at their cash and debt. They have more cash than debt right now. In fact, last quarter, Texas Roadhouse paid off the remainder of all of their long-term debt. So they have zero long-term debt. The only thing they have in terms of liabilities is their capital leases, which are basically rental payments on their restaurants. But this is it. They have a lot of cash. They have no long-term debt, which gives them an incredible amount of flexibility in their capital allocation. So not only do I have incredible confidence that this company can continue to pay a dividend, I have lots of confidence that they can grow it at a continually attractive rate. And this all comes down to the financials and economics of a company. Invest in companies that are paying a dividend, that have growing revenues, cash flows, net income, earnings per share. Companies that have declining share count and strong balance sheets. Those are ones that will be able to continually pay growing dividends in the future. So I believe dividend investors would be well-served to stop focusing their efforts so much on high-starting yields. Instead, focus on companies that have everything in place to have strong organic dividend growth for a long period of time in the future. Companies that can do this have great economics, good competitive dynamics, companies that have very strong balance sheets. These are ones that lead to alpha, to outperformance. These are the strong dividend companies that pay year after year after year. The ones that have the high starting yields, the ones that are value traps, they often lead investors down the worst route, where they're stuck in a company where the only reason they own it is a dividend, and they eventually capitulate and end up selling it. We've all been in those companies at one point or another, so it's time to focus on better companies. Now, the next big mistake that I see a lot of dividend investors making is over-diversification. Now, diversification is not all bad. I don't think you should be all-inning a single company. That is overall very risky. There's two different types of basic risks in the stock market. There's specific risk, what are specific to a company, meaning the management team, the chance the company does fraud, the chance the company gets out-competed by a different company. Those are all specific risks to a specific company. But then there's systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of the overall world economy. Things like pandemics, things like wars, things like famine. These are systematic risks that we really can't diversify away from. So diversification is an opportunity for us to lower the amount of risk of specific risks, specific to any singular company. But the data shows empirically that once you have over 7 to 10 different companies, the specific risk is basically diversified away to the max extent. It's mostly gone at that point. And beyond then, layering on more and more companies, 10 companies, 15 companies, 20 companies, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, you're getting no more benefits of reduced risk. At that point, all you're doing is cluttering a portfolio full of tons of different companies without the benefit of any measurable risk reduction. Not only are you not really getting any additional benefit of reducing specific risk, but you're also getting the downside of having an overly complex portfolio of a group of companies that you can't possibly pay attention to extensively. So you're making individual investments, but you're spreading them out across so many companies that you really can't keep up with all of them. In my portfolio, I've tried to mimic it where I'm getting the most bang for my buck. I have 10 core positions. S&P Global, MasterCard, Intuit, Microsoft and Apple, that's five, Vici, Costco, Texas Roadhouse, Canadian Pacific, and Union Pacific. Right at 10 core positions, I'm getting the maximum benefit of reducing specific risk. I'm right in that nice part of the curve there, but I also don't have so many companies that I can't possibly keep track of them. I can keep track of 10 companies. So I do believe in being diversified, but not being over diversified. And a lot of portfolios I see from dividend investors. Are portfolios with 50 different companies. So many companies that half the time, I think these investors can't even remember the amount of companies they have in their portfolios. If you're doing that, you're just lazily investing, putting money into dozens and dozens of companies without properly doing research on them. And then finally, the last thing that I see a lot of dividend investors doing that I think is a mistake is investing into bad industries, bad companies and bad industries. Now, this can come off as a very harsh criticism, me saying that these are bad companies, but this is just my opinion. I do think a lot of the investments that dividend investors buy are in companies that are a lot of industrials. They're capital intensive. They're overly complex. A lot of these industries are incredibly difficult to operate in. And I've made this same mistake before. So when I'm criticizing other people's investments, I'm criticizing my previous investments as well. I used to own $300 of Boeing. It was one of my first investments. I viewed the company as this big duopoly with Airbus. It was just one of the big companies that seemed like it was unbeatable to me. But what I quickly learned is that Boeing is an incredibly complex company. It has an entire chain of events that has to happen. Huge manufacturing processes, tons of quality assurance, tons of liability, potential lawsuits, long-term contracts. The amount of complexity in this business is incredible. Running it would be trying to run a small country. So Boeing's one of these companies that's incredibly complex, difficult to understand, very capital intensive, and has tons of various risk factors that investors can't properly put into their analysis. There's no way you can accurately quantify the amount of risk in this company. And I see the same thing with a lot of other industries that I consider to not be the greatest industries to invest in. Intel being an example of how unpredictable it is to be a chip maker. NVIDIA is leading the race right now. NVIDIA is what's drawing everybody's attention. But Intel was king not too long ago. They controlled the world with chips. And now how far they've fallen. And I see so many investors getting drawn into these companies. 3M, another company having a high dividend yield, that's been one that so far has been a value trap for a long period of time. Down 9% over the past 10 years. The companies that I've been gravitating to, and I've been trying to urge investors to gravitate to, are ones that are more simple, and have economics that are better for longer periods of time. S&P Global shares a monopoly between them and Moody's. Both companies benefit mutually. I've been bullish on Microsoft for a long period of time, a company that has great competitive dynamics by virtue of its massive monopolistic moat. Even Costco's a company that's seemingly more expensive, but it's more predictable. And it has a more simple business model that's easier to operate and easier to execute. It's much easier to open up a new warehouse and sell some memberships, than it is to try to create the next big aircraft. So my final piece of advice for dividend investors is to focus on industries that are overall good industries, where everybody's winning in that industry, where you're fishing in a good pond, not trying to pick winners amongst losers. Focus on companies that aren't capital intensive or overly complex, ones that are simple and predictable. If we do this, I think we'll have better returns overall. And I think that dividend investing will be looked at more favorably overall. It won't be so associated with buying slow-growing, complex companies that are in many cases value traps. This is what I've been doing with my portfolio. It's the strategy that I've been merging over to. And I think it more closely mimics and aligns with what Warren Buffett did his entire career, especially his early career. Focusing on companies that not only paid him cash flows, but they had strong organic growth profiles that would pay him growing cash flows in the future, and then reinvesting those cash flows into other good opportunities. So that's my thoughts overall on this issue, and my biggest advice of what I've learned over the past five years. Let me know what you think. If you disagree, that's fine. But let me know either way. I'd be happy to discuss in the comments. Now moving on, we have some big news from Mark Zuckerberg making some big moves. He's now competing directly with Twitter. Meta has unveiled to employees a standalone app it plans to launch through Instagram to compete with Twitter. Now it's interesting wordage there. They say it's a standalone app, but they're going to launch it through Instagram. We'll get to what that means in a minute here. They say that this was revealed by Chris Cox, the chief product officer. Cox told employees that Meta has heard from creators and public figures who want a quote, sanely run platform. The people that I think want a sanely run platform are a lot of, I think, politicians that don't like that Elon is running Twitter. They don't like that he's running the platform. It's a highly political thing. So people have very, very strong views on Elon. Some people don't like him. If they don't like him, they don't want to support the platform. So they want an alternative. Those people are the one that are saying that Elon's not sane. He's not running the company sanely. So they want an alternative. And Meta is there to the rescue. The company is in talks to have people such as Oprah Winfrey and Dalai Lama commit to using the app. Adding that Meta hopes to launch it, quote, as soon as we can. And the app is internally codenamed Project 92, a person familiar with the software said. Why they named it that, I have no clue. It sounds kind of cool, but we don't know anything about the name there. So we don't have much details on this. But let me make a very early judgment here based on the history that I've studied with Meta. This is what they're best at. This is right in their wheelhouse. This is what they consider to be their superpower. They can take different features from different social media. They can integrate it or rebuild it. And then they can push major usage and engagement on it. Meta has proven their ability to do this over and over and over again. Reels and stories were features that they took from different platforms. They integrated it onto an existing platform to great success. But this is a bit of a more aggressive challenge. They're not only trying to just integrate a new feature. They're trying to completely replicate Twitter and do it better and build it to a successful platform. So this is what they're good at. But I think this is a bit more aggressive. I think it's a bit more risky. But I'm still going to side on the side of Meta. I think they'll be able to pull this off. I think they'll be able to push major engagement and usage on the Twitter competitor. And the reason being is that they've proven, again, that they're incredibly good at this. What they're doing is they're launching it through Instagram. So what I assume they're going to be doing with this is they're going to be using your information you've already given them on Instagram to auto-populate accounts on this new Twitter competitor. Now that you have your account already made, you already have the onboarding process done. All you have to do is just log in and open it up. You have your Twitter copy account. So Meta is removing all the friction by using all the information they already have to bridge the gap between Instagram and the Twitter competitor. If they did it that way, that would be a brilliant move by Meta and make the chances of success even greater for this. So we don't know if this is going to be ultimately successful so far. But if I was a Meta investor, I would be pretty bullish on this. I do think it's something that's going to be a likely success. Now on the same subject of Meta and Mark Zuckerberg, we get to see his initial first public reaction to the Apple Vision Pro headset. A little bit of background between Mark Zuckerberg and Apple. Mark Zuckerberg is very calm and he's very level-headed in the way that he talks about Apple and the way that he talks about Tim Cook. But I believe strongly that underneath this very calm demeanor, there is a certain hatred that he has for Apple. I don't think that he only dislikes the company and has a friendly competition with them. I think he has utter disdain for them. Apple has been bullying Meta mercilessly, doing ad changes, doing things that hurt his business and take billions of dollars out of his company, his employees, and his wallet. And he doesn't like that. Mark Zuckerberg is incredibly competitive. He's shown that in both his personal life and his business life. He doesn't like being beholden to Apple. In order to circumvent Apple and their App Store policies, Mark Zuckerberg has been looking for ways to go around the hardware monopoly that Apple has. And his way of doing that is not through the phone, not through the laptop, but through the headset. He believes that this is the next generation of computing. He's come out with the Oculus. He's made massive investments into this category in hopes to have his own physical platform where he no longer has to operate through Apple's App Store monopoly. But then we have Apple releasing the Vision Pro. In my estimation, I think that Apple did what they do best. They came out with a premium item. It has higher resolution, lower latency, has very good specs, very good build quality, and overall seems like a highly polished device. It comes in at a more expensive price point, and that's the major focus. But here we have the head-to-head battle between Meta and Oculus in all of his various headsets and the Apple Vision Pro. Here's what Zuckerberg said in his initial reaction seeing the Vision Pro release. A few high-level thoughts. I mean, first, I do think that this is a certain level of validation for the category, right? Where we were the primary folks out there before saying, hey, I think that this virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, this is going to be a big part of the next computing platform. I think having Apple come in and share that vision will make a lot of people who are fans of their products really consider that. And then the first one that he makes is one of product and category validation. By Apple entering in to the AR VR headset game, they have thus validated that category of product as being a valid product. And that logic seems simple. I think this is a very good go-to reaction by Mark Zuckerberg. The problem is, this is the reaction that literally every CEO says when Apple steps into their category and competes directly with them. Take, for example, when Apple stepped into fitness. They offer a fitness service called Fitness Plus. Peloton was already in this game. They're the biggest ones by far in this category. The Peloton CEO was one of optimism, saying that it's, quote, quite a legitimization of fitness content. That is the big headline there. Apple entering into the category is a good thing. It legitimizes fitness content. And it's overall going to lead to greater sales for Peloton. But the stock price since this was posted for Peloton is down around 70%. And there's no evidence whatsoever that Apple entering in to fitness content has helped Peloton whatsoever. All it's done is created a massive competitor to something that they uniquely owned. Companies should be able to legitimize their own products without having the biggest, most powerful company in the world compete directly with them. When Apple competed with Amazon with the Fire Phone, it didn't help them. And it certainly didn't help the Zoom when they competed with Microsoft. When Apple steps in and competes headfirst with a separate company, saying it legitimizes a category is a nice thing to say. But I don't see a lot of evidence that that's the case. The next thing that he moves on to is the big price point. Apple's headset at $3,500 is unaffordable. Way too expensive for most people. This reminds me a little bit of Steve Ballmer being asked about the iPhone. Steve, let me ask you about the iPhone and the Zoom, if I may. Zoom was getting some traction. Then Steve Jobs goes to Macworld and he pulls out this iPhone. What was your first reaction when you saw that? $500? The first thing that comes out of his mouth in criticism of Apple being a legitimate competitor to Microsoft was $500. At the time, that was extremely expensive for a phone. Far more expensive than any competitor or any existing phone on the market. And Apple was likewise, scoffed at and mocked for being way too expensive and far out of reach of other people. Now, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't say this with as mocking of a tone, but the concern is very similar. So I think that there's a chance that them coming in actually increases demand for the overall space and that Quest 3 is actually the primary beneficiary of that. Because a lot of the people who might say, hey, I'm going to give another consideration to this. Or now I understand maybe what mixed reality is more. And Quest 3 is the best one on the market that I can afford. And it's great also, right? I think that that's, you know, in our own way, I think we're, and there are a lot of features that we have where we're leading on. Maybe in a way the Vision Pro will create more demand for meta, but I don't typically see that the case throughout history. When people want an Apple device, they don't say, I want an iPad. But the iPad's a little too expensive, so I'm going to go get a Kindle. I'm going to go get, I'm going to go get a Fire tablet. That's not often the case. There's always a secondary market. Maybe that will happen in some cases. But in most cases, when real users want to pay for a real device, they get the thing that they want. They have different ways of financing, different ways of saving, different ways of paying for it. If someone really wants to get an iPhone, they're going to find a way to get it. And then obviously over time, the companies are just focused on somewhat different things, right? Apple has always, I think, focused on building really kind of high-end things, whereas our focus has been on, it's just, we have a more democratic ethos. We want to build things that are accessible to a wider number of people. We've sold tens of millions of Quest devices. My understanding, just based on rumors, I don't have any special knowledge on this, is that Apple is building about 1 million of their device, right? The next thing he brings up is one of accessibility. His company is building stuff that's accessible by many, many people. It's not priced out of them. This is another argument that looking at the data, it falls flat. He's painting Apple as this company that only sells premium devices to only a very small number of users. Apple's install base over the past seven years has estimatedly doubled from 1 billion installed devices to over 2 billion installed devices. If Apple's devices are so undemocratic and so inaccessible, then why do they have an install base of devices that exceeds 2 billion? That doesn't stack up. Obviously, lots of people are able to get Apple's devices. Lots of people from various income levels. We kind of come at it from different places. We're very focused on social interaction, communication, being more active, right? So there's fitness, there's gaming, there are those things. Whereas I think a lot of the use cases that you saw in Apple's launch material were more around people sitting, people looking at screens, which are great. I think that you will replace your laptop over time with a headset. But I think in terms of kind of how the different use cases that the companies are going after, they're a bit different for where we are right now. This is another reaction that I think is a little soft. I think it's a bit weak. He's trying to paint Apple's devices being anti-social and his devices being very, very social. But when we looked at the actual presentation, there's not much distinction in terms of social capability. Apple demonstrated plenty of social apps with FaceTime, 3D videoing, looking at a wall of people and friends in real time. There's lots of this type of thing of them standing up and being active as they're working. And a big thing to keep in mind is the hardware and device capability is just the product that's able to launch the apps. The app builders will get into the Vision Pro now and build many social apps. I anticipate that on the Vision Pro, on Apple's devices, there will be just as many social capabilities as there are on Metas. Now, overall, I like the fact that Mark Zuckerberg will sit down and speak so candidly about his reaction and about his goals and ambitions. I think it's good that he's competing with Apple. But if I have to pick the overall winner of who I think would dominate this market, my vote still stands with Apple. I think they'll have much bigger market share of the overall economics of this device category. Similar with how they do with the tablet, with the MacBook, with the phone, with the AirPods, with every other device category that they're in. I see no big distinction with headsets. Now, finally, we get to the most important part of the show. This is where we get our best tips, our best advice financially. This is one on the best house hacking tip ever, which comes at a very important time. Because right now, it's difficult to get into homes. They're very expensive. This person right here has a solution for it. People are always complaining about how expensive housing is. They say it's so unaffordable, they can't afford it. 20% down is just too much for them. I think they're just making excuses, in my opinion. But let me tell you why. How much is a 20% down payment on a $1 million house? $200,000? $200,000. Okay. Let me ask you this. How many kidneys do you have? Two? All right. That caught me off guard there a little bit. He went from what is the down payment on a million dollar home, a 20% down payment. And now we're talking about, I think I heard kidneys. How many kidneys do you have? We went from house hacking to now human biology. Let's go ahead and keep listening here. I think I know what direction he's going, but let's take a look. Now, how many kidneys does the average person need to survive? One. One. How much do you think that you could sell a kidney for in the black market today? $250,000? $300,000? $350,000? We'll say $250,000. You take your kidney, you sell it. $200,000. I thought this was a house hacking tip, not a human hacking tip. He's saying that you can hawk your kidney on the black market for a quarter million. Now, I have no way of verifying this. I have not looked into the price of a kidney. Maybe this is correct. That's a lot of money. $250,000. But I'd still rather have my kidneys instead of trying to do some type of illegal surgery. But regardless, let's just assume for a minute this is accurate information. $250,000. You take that $50,000, you put it in your pocket, you don't need to look at it. You take that $200,000, you put it out on a down payment on a $1 million house. You rent that house for three years. Three years. You make your money back. You buy your kidney back. You reinsert it back into your body. Now what? Now you have two kidneys. And you have a $1 million asset. I don't know what to say. I normally am critical of these type of TikToks. I think that some of them are a little silly. But this one's pretty genius, I must admit. You only have to risk death twice by taking your kidney and selling it in the black market. A surgery that I can't imagine being done with the best doctors or surgeons. But then you also have to reinsert it back into your body and reconnect it. Which I can't imagine as well as being a great surgery. And by the way, I think surgeries are somewhat expensive. So out of that $250,000, some of it's probably going to the surgeon or whoever's doing the surgery. It seems like he may be leaving out a few details there. But there we have it. The most extreme house hacking tip I've ever heard. That's all for this episode. Have a great weekend. I'll see you in the next one.\n",

      " Today on the Joseph Carlson Show, I've made some changes. I recently sold 100% of one of my holdings, and I've used all of the proceeds of that sale to buy into a brand new position. Now, I'm not gonna hold you in suspense. The company that I sold is Canadian Pacific. I sold out of the entire position, and I did so to buy Google. I bought $27,000 of Google in the passive income portfolio. Now, you may point out that Google's up 6% today. Is it really a good idea to buy a company after it just went up in price? Well, I actually didn't make this trade today. I did it on the 28th, which was Monday. Monday, of course, was a day before Google's earnings. So I purchased $27,000 of Google stock one day before earnings. Over just yesterday and today with Google's earnings report, the stock is up around 7%. So I'm already around $2,000 in the green on this holding that I've held for two days. This has been a great start to the Google position in the passive income portfolio. But if you're new to Google, and you're just investing in this company for the first time, luckily for you, I think there's more to go. Investors today still don't fully appreciate what Google did. I'll be going over why I believe Google today is worth well above $200 per share. We'll be going through the facts of this report, the reality of the situation, and what's going to be driving Google stock above $200 per share. Now, before diving into the details of this latest earnings report, I think it's good to start off with my recent trade into Google, because this was more of an abrupt decision than my typical trades. Like I said, two days ago on Monday, I made one of the most significant trades I've done in the entire year of 2024. I sold entirely out of my position, Canadian Pacific, and I purchased $27,000 of those proceeds into Google. If you've been a follower of this channel for some time, this shouldn't come as a surprise. I've been talking about selling Canadian Pacific for months. So this is something that I've talked about, I said I was going to do, and I finally did. Now, just a couple thoughts on Canadian Pacific. First of all, I don't buy bad companies, and Canadian Pacific is no different. This company is a really, really good company. It is a class one railroad that spans all across North America. Nothing is going to be able to disrupt this company for a long period of time. So I'm not selling Canadian Pacific because it suddenly turned into a bad company. That's not the case here. I sold Canadian Pacific because of opportunity cost. I have a limited amount of capital to work with, and every dollar that I have invested, I feel like should be working the hardest for me as possible. I want every dollar of this portfolio to be working and compounding as fast as I can make it. And frankly, when I looked over my portfolio over and over again, I thought I had better growth prospects than Canadian Pacific. So I sold this company simply because I can outperform it with other holdings that I choose. Now, selling is a tough decision, and when I decided to do that, I needed to find a place to put the money. And the problem was, is that most of the companies in my portfolio are not in any kind of dip. In fact, most of them are surging upwards. I would have loved to buy more Salesforce, but the company's not in a dip anymore. It's now $5,000 in the green. The stock price is now up to $300 per share. And throughout the year, it traded at much cheaper prices, which is where I was buying it. So Salesforce has now closed that gap. Booking Holdings, another company that I'm very bullish on, that I purchased a lot of earlier this year. It's grown a lot. I'm up 24% on this position, up $10,000. Booking Holdings went through a temporary dip that was an entry point into this stock. I was buying the company right around here, $3,300 per share. And over just the past three months, the company surged from $3,300 up to $4,300. So the stock price is up $1,000 per share. At this point, I'd rather just hold my position than buy more. There's other options like Texas Roadhouse, but frankly, this company's grown to a point where it's now so big, it's one of the largest companies in my portfolio. An $85,000 position with $50,000 of that being gains. Do I really want to add more to the restaurant chain when it's grown to my third largest position? I don't think so. I just don't feel good about adding to it when it's going through this much momentum and positive sentiment. The situation I'm in currently is having a lot of great companies trading at not so great prices. Companies are no longer at a deal. The situation of finding easy buys in the market is getting more and more difficult as prices are going up and they're going up quickly. I was looking at my watch list, trying to get creative, looking at other potential companies like DoorDash. This is one that's seen astronomical growth that has huge network effects. But again, it's up 50% in just the past three months and I don't feel like chasing stocks. Uber's another great option, but I'm always concerned with Uber, the threat of Waymo or Tesla's RoboTaxi. And likewise, Uber's recently threw a price surge. Uber for me is a no-go right now as well. After looking around for a while of where to put this capital, I kept coming back to Google. This is a company that I believed at the time had by far the best risk and reward. Google stock is currently up around 30% year to date, but just two days ago, it was only up 17%. Google stock was trading at a 19 Ford PE ratio. That seemed rather cheap for a company of Google's stature. The valuation was so low on this company and the reason was very clear. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the Department of Justice lawsuit against Google, the potential for a breakup, and the concerns of Google losing their search market share to competitors like Perplexity, like OpenAI with Bing, and other AI search engines. Many intelligent investors have been sounding the alarm for Google for a while. Brad Gerstner 10 months ago said that Google won't be able to replicate the search dominance in AI. In the appearance on CNBC, he infused further affairs about Google, stating how they're in a position to lose a lot of market share. With other investors sounding similar alarms, we've seen Google stock trail behind the S&P 500. The company seemed like it was getting a bid earlier this year, only to fall back down, going all the way back down until only 17% returns on the year. While at the same time, growing earnings per share at 30%. While at the same time, trading at a lower PE ratio than the S&P 500. The stock price for Google felt very depressed, and it still does. So when looking at the depressed share price of Google and the valuation compared against the rest of the market, I viewed this as an asymmetric bet, meaning that it had far more upside than it had downside. The risk and reward was heavily skewed towards the upside. And that is because I believe strongly that investors are overemphasizing the fares in Google and not emphasizing enough the qualities of this company. On Monday morning, I posted on my Discord that I was making this trade. And I'll read you a little bit of the post. I said that I sold my entire Canadian Pacific position to start a new position in Google in the passive income account. Google is not a perfect company, but I view the risk right now with Google as heavily skewed, with low downside and ample upside. Now I did say that on a private Discord on Monday, but I also made it very clear publicly in my YouTube video on Monday that I was bullish going into these earnings. In a video on Monday, I said this, and I have to believe that eventually the fares will fade with Google. The Department of Justice and the scary headlines about them breaking up Google will be a thing of the past. Meanwhile, Google will continue to grow their earnings and their revenue. And right now, frankly, the valuation is very forgiving. Google doesn't have to be perfect. They just have to keep growing at all. If the company remains at the exact same multiple, but they continue to grow, 10 to 15% earnings per share per year, you're still getting a very attractive return at this point. So aside from the fact, I think the company's undervalued, I think Google should be over $200 today. I think even so, even if it's undervalued and it remains undervalued, it will still be an attractive return profile from here. That's what I said on Monday. I feel like I couldn't have made it any clearer that I was bullish on the company. After all, I'm not gonna come right out and say you should buy a company. I give my opinion on things and you can make your own decisions. So that's the story of me buying the stock and making this change in my portfolio. Now, if you're looking at Google today and you believe you've missed the train, that it's already left the station, I don't believe that's the case. I believe there's evidence that there's a lot more room to run for Google. Let's first start off with just valuation. It is true that Google's up $10 or plus 5.5% on the day. And it was up a little bit yesterday. So Google's on a good run. The stock price has surged over the past few days. That can, of course, dissuade you from buying a company. But if we look at the valuation of Google stock, it still remains very low. Right now, the forward PE ratio based on some estimates is around a 19 forward PE. Many analysts believe that Google will do around $8.70 of earnings in 2025 based on a $180 stock price that puts the current forward PE at 20. So Google, even today, even after the surge upwards, is still trading below the S&P 500, below Meta, below Microsoft, below Apple, below all the rest of them. It's one of the cheaper companies in the market even after this report. Google did a lot of great things in this report. We can start off with the revenue. Alphabet increased revenues 15% or 16% in a constant currency basis. So this is what the overall revenue growth looks like on the longer term. 15% growth overall looks very healthy for a company like this. When we break it down by segment, this is again what it looks like. 15% revenue growth overall. Google services increased by 13% led by strength across Google search and other Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices, and YouTube ads. One of the biggest things we've heard about Google is how they're losing market share in search, how things are going downhill, as Bing, OpenAI, perplexity, are all taking Google search business. And we should be very, very scared as investors. But again, we have another quarter of looking at just Google search and seeing strong revenue growth. Revenue growth of above 10%. That's not the sign of a weak business. That's not the sign of a company that's suffering from competitive forces. On the earnings call, Sundar Pichai talked at length about YouTube, saying that it's getting more watch time on the TV, pitting it directly against streaming services like Netflix. And they're focusing on the TV experience, making it feel more premium, making it feel better to navigate on the television. So YouTube is now expanding from use primarily on desktops and phones onto the TV. The growth path seems very long for YouTube. So we had revenue growth that beat analyst estimates by a couple billion dollars. And we have their earnings per share reported as $2.12. If we look at the Qualtrum earnings week calendar, we can take a look at this earnings per share beat. We have it right here. This was the earnings per share that they recorded this quarter, $2.12. Now, if we take a look at what the analysts were estimating this quarter, it was $1.85. That is a significant beat. They beat the earnings per share by a 15% margin. And again, if we look at the revenue, they also beat analyst estimates by a wide margin, the $88.2 billion. If we look at the estimate, it was $86.39. Right away, just these top and bottom line numbers in and of themselves should prove the doubters wrong. Google is still growing at a very fast pace, faster than what the analysts are expecting, faster than what's being priced into the stock with its current valuation. But it doesn't end here. Sundar Pichai on the earnings report and in the call talked at length about AI and how it's helping their business. He says the AI features are expanding what people can search for and how they can search for it. In cloud, our AI solutions are helping drive deeper product adoption with existing customers, attract new customers and win larger deals. And YouTube's total ads and subscription revenue surpassed 50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time. We generated strong revenue in the quarter and our ongoing effort to improve efficiency helped deliver improved margins. Sundar is attacking the problems on every front. First of all, starting with AI. He notes that the AI business and their search is not being hurt. In fact, it's helping expand their features. He mentions in the call that AI is also helping Google internally. For example, 25% of the code at Google is being written by AI. So Google's seeing a huge internal productivity boost by artificial intelligence just in writing code. AI is helping them with their cloud effort and you can see it show up in the numbers. Google Cloud blew past estimates from $8.4 billion in the most recent quarter of the previous year to $11.35 billion this quarter of this year. That is massive growth in cloud. If we give this some context, we can filter out the other revenue segments and just look at Google Cloud. They grew up by 35%. Now again, if we erase this quarter and we went back to the previous quarter, it was growing at 27%. So Google Cloud growth accelerated dramatically. 35% revenue growth in cloud is wild. And the more astonishing thing is that even though the revenue is accelerating in cloud, so are the margins. The most recent quarter, the operating margins for Google Cloud were 17%. That is a very large jump from the quarter before it at 11%. And there's still room for improvement on both fronts. Google Cloud will continue to grow revenue and continue to increase margins. Over time, this will become a substantial portion of Google's operating income. Now, another thing that Sundar Pachai mentioned that's easy to overlook is the improved efficiency. He talked about that a number of times on the earnings call as well, saying that they are working close to look at the structure of Google and make sure the company is running as efficient as possible. And this time he really means it. One of the ways to look at a company running efficiently is if they're growing their revenue rapidly, if they're growing their margins, while keeping the number of employees flat. And Google is doing that. The number of employees last year at the same quarter were 182,000. The number of employees this quarter were 181,000. Meaning that as they're growing the revenue 15%, they have an overall reduction in employees. If anything, right now, they're keeping the number of employees relatively flat while gaining revenue. And there you see increased efficiencies. So in summary, right now, Google search is strong and still growing. YouTube has a dominant moat and is still growing. Google cloud growth is accelerating while margins are expanding. Google's earnings per share are increasing rapidly, above 35% year over year. Google's buying back billions of dollars worth of shares every quarter, reducing the total share count by 2% year over year. Google's also paying billions of dollars a year in the form of a dividend that will grow every year. Google's moderating their expenses in research and development, general and administrative, sales and marketing. Every portion of the company is being more careful and moderating their cost over time. And right now, even after the company's given this report, even today, it still trades at a 19 or 24 PE ratio. Google stock is headed in the right direction, but it's still not appropriately priced, and it should be worth more today. So what is it gonna take for Google to get above $200 per share? What will we have to see from the analysts? I've seen analysts go on to CNBC and become increasingly bullish on this company as they continue to report quarter after quarter. Gene Munster is one that's overall positive on Google. And the reason is that 10, seven, 10 years ago, there was a lot of debate about how mobile was gonna impact the business. And of course, that's been the narrative around Google for the last year, is how is AI gonna impact the business? And what we saw in their US business, that is where the AI overviews saw the first full quarter. The expectations were that it was gonna grow at 12%, it grew at 19%. And I think that this is the first evidence and the call has just been a chorus of commentary about how AI overviews is having a positive impact on the business. Now, we're not out of the woods yet, Google investors, but I think that this is a most encouraging data point after a lot of hand-wringing over the last several quarters. Gene is correct. There's been so much concern about the search business, and no matter what Google says, no matter what the numbers say, investors are still concerned about this business. But if the search business keeps growing and the naysayers are eventually proven wrong, which they will be, Google's gonna be a good bet from here. Now, one thing that Google did talk about in their earnings call is their other bet segment. That is where they fund different, more experimental projects, the main one being Waymo. And they mentioned that Waymo is by far the most advanced autonomous network that's actively taking fares for rides today. Waymo is now completing over 150,000 rides per week. Gene was asked about their remarks on Waymo as well. Well, the reason why it doesn't get credit is that it's just such a small part of the business. We were doing some of the numbers on it today. They're doing about 30 million. They didn't report this, but you can back into it, about 30 million a year in revenue. So it's like a speck of revenue. And if it grows a lot, it's still gonna be relatively small. And so I think this probably ends up better as a standalone company and where investors, Google investors may benefit 5% or 10% from Waymo. Gene downplays the impact of Waymo, saying that it's basically just a speck of revenue. It's not that important. And it's probably better for it to end up as a standalone company. And he couldn't be more wrong on this subject. First of all, Waymo is growing rapidly. They went from 100,000 rides per week now to 150,000. Why would Google want to sell off their most promising other bet segment? Why would they sell off Waymo when it's making this much progress? I have to believe that Gene's bullishness on Tesla, the fact that he is an investor in Tesla, he owns that stock, he wants it to be successful, and he talks very glowingly about Tesla's Robotaxi network, has to be impacting his comments on Google. Tesla is being priced as a $800 billion company in part because of the promise of a Robotaxi network. And right now, Waymo is currently building that out city by city. So no, I don't believe that right now is the time for Google to sell Waymo. Not right now when it's gaining steam, unlocking new territories, iterating on costs, and becoming more efficient. I think as a Tesla investor, you would like to advise Google to sell Waymo because it might help out Tesla, but selling Waymo does not help Google. Now, as we look at Google overall as a business, the point that I can't emphasize enough is the growth of cloud. If we look back at the cloud business in Q1 of 2021, it made up around 7% of Google's total revenue. So it was a rather small portion of the business. Now, even though the other segments of Google's business are growing rather rapidly, most of them are growing around 14% or more, Google Cloud is growing even faster. So Google Cloud is making up a bigger and bigger percentage of the overall business over time. And in the most recent quarter, it makes up roughly 11% of their total revenue. And this trend will continue as Google Cloud is growing, double to triple the speed of the rest of the business. It'll go from 7% to 11% of Google, upwards to 15%, and then 20%. The narrative will shift where Google Cloud is a major portion of this business. Mark Mahaney talks about the importance of cloud and why he's so bullish on it. Which should be a positive read-through for AWS and for Microsoft too. Cloud as an industry we think is accelerating kind of across the board for a variety of reasons, one of which is AI workloads, Gen AI workloads. He also mentions the strength in Google to be able to grow this business as much as they did, accelerating revenue growth while having a big jump in margins. And then the other thing I thought was impressive about the business kind of stood out to us were the margins. They had sort of warned us, told us that they were going to kind of step up headcount hiring in the September quarter, but the margins were essentially flattish. So I think that's a sign, but we want to get into it in the earnings call of newfound efficiencies and cost savings in the business model. And I think there's probably a lot more if you get a new CFO, CFO that really wants to dig into it. He mentions that more margin expansion is likely on the way with this new CFO. So overall having Google trade up plus 5% on a day where the QQQ is in the red is a good start. It's in the right direction, but I still don't believe that this is enough. There's no guarantees, but I still believe that Google has a lot of room to run here. And I think the company's still worth well above $200. We'll see how things go over the upcoming months, but so far I'm excited about this new holding in the passive income account. Now, if you want to see my coverage of the other companies reporting earnings after market close today, Microsoft Meta, Starbucks and Booking, make sure to subscribe to this channel and the Joseph Carlson After Hours channel. I'll have more content out this week. That's all for now. See you in the next one.\n",

      " Today on the Joseph Carlson Show, my portfolio reached an all-new high, and the stock market reached an all-new high. We have lots of people excited about the market reaching a new high. We have Jeremy Siegel calling in, expressing his excitement for the Fed, lowering interest rates by 50 basis points. We're going to be looking at why he thinks this is such a good decision from the Fed. We also have news that Amazon is introducing an AI bot for their third party sellers. Olive Garden just reported their earnings, and it was a huge recovery. The stock price is jumping, and Walmart is taking big steps to battle credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard. We'll be taking a look at what they're doing with these instant bank payments and how it may affect these credit card companies. And then of course, we're getting to the weekend, so it's time to check up on Financial TikTok. This one is actually Financial Rails, but it's very similar. This individual shares how he manages to have multiple jobs at the same time that are all high paying, and he built a business doing so. We'll be taking a look at his advice in this episode. Now let's go ahead and move on to the main story. The market is reaching an all-time high, and my portfolio likewise has reached an all-time high on the day. We now have $271,000 in gains, which is incredible. Just today, the portfolio is up 1.63%, which is around $12,000. So it's a big day for the market. It's a big day likely for your portfolio. Hopefully, you've stayed invested in the market. Hopefully, you've ignored all the bears trying to scare you out of the market. In many ways, today's a day that you can celebrate. As investors, I think it's good to have time periods where you're just happy about what's going on with your portfolios. Companies are growing their earnings, companies are gaining value, and the market is rewarding investors taking on this risk. I, for one, am excited about what's going on. I'm excited about what's happening with my companies. The biggest contributors to my portfolio this year have come from three different investments. The first one is in the restaurant category, which is Texas Roadhouse. My total gains in Texas Roadhouse are $38,000, but if I filter that just by this year, we can click on the year to date and see that just this year, it's up $21,000. That is a huge gain for a single year in a company like this. My next biggest one is in the consumer category. And of course, we have the rocket ship, which is Costco. Overall, a $43,000 gain. When I filter just by the year to date, Costco has gone up $21,000, matching Texas Roadhouse's gains. If we look at third place, it's in the financial category. We have S&P Global. Overall, it's up $33,000. If we filter by the year to date, it's up $18,000. This has been another great performer. So those are the companies that have contributed the most to my portfolio this year. Now, if I look at the worst performing holdings in my portfolio this year, I can also outline the top three. The worst one so far this year is Salesforce. It's down $2,000. This is the only company that I'm in the red. It's the only company I hold that's lost money this year. Next up, we have Vici. Overall, Vici is in the green by around $12,000. So it's been a good holding over the years. But year to date, it just hasn't kept up with the market. If I filter by just this year, it's only up $500. And then the third worst performing position in my portfolio is Canadian Pacific. It's up $4,500 overall. If I filter it by just this year, the company is up $3,600. Overall, again, I can't complain. And I'm very excited about what's going on with my companies. I feel like they've been performing to my expectations. And in some cases, they've been pleasantly surprising me, performing better than I expect. Now you might say, hey, Joseph, you're excited. You said you're not supposed to get excited when the market goes up. And that's true. In my own investing philosophy, where I go over stock selection and the temperament and the portfolio management to be a great investor, the first thing I outline from investors that have good temperament is they don't get excited when the market goes up. And here I am excited and celebrating that the market's going up. So maybe this needs a little bit more clarification. When I say don't get excited that the market's going up, I don't mean that you need to suppress all joy and emotion when investing. I think it's good to be happy about things, to celebrate landmarks, to be excited when your portfolio is making gains. Where I draw the line in terms of investing is acting excitedly, acting impulsively, piling more money into top performing positions by chasing gains. When you translate being excited into acting excited, you start to make dumb decisions. And I think it's time to be careful that we don't use the exuberance in the market and translate that into greed. It's okay to highlight companies that are doing really well, but in some cases that can translate directly into temptation, into pushing all your money further and further into these companies. And I don't believe that's the best investment strategy. Rather, we should take a disciplined approach. We should look at the companies based on their fundamentals and their valuations. We should continually look to invest in the ones that we believe have the best risk and reward. In this case, in my portfolio, I still think that Salesforce is one of the best risk and rewards based on the valuation and growth potential, even though it's the one that has performed the worst year to date. So when I say don't get excited when the market goes up, I don't mean you always have to be somber. I don't mean you always have to have a scowled look on your face. I'm not suggesting we all be like Gurney and Dune. I am smiling. It's okay to smile. Being happy about your returns is not going to make you a bad investor. Hubris and emotionally driven decisions are what cause investors to fail. So I am pleased with the way things are going today. And if you've been investing well, you should be too. If we look at what's driving the market today, of course it was the rate cuts that happened yesterday. That's really the one major piece of news that we can attribute this large rally to. Now there is some confusion. The rate cuts happened during market trading yesterday and the market ended in the red and then it surged up a day after. It's a little confusing when the market decides to trade down the day that they announced the big rate cuts, but then trade up suddenly the next day. And this goes into all the different driving factors of the market in the short term. There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes. There's some analysts that have looked at this and they've tried to determine why the market went down yesterday and is up today. After closing lower yesterday, the stock market suddenly loves the Federal Reserve's half point rate cut. It may say more about trading under Fed chair Jerome Powell than anything about monetary policy. The stock market initially popped following yesterday's rate decision before wild trading took hold. The S&P 500 repeatedly pressed against its highs before pulling back and finishing the day down. So there was a lot of aggressive trading going on yesterday. Charlie Ashley, a portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds, said, quote, the moves in equities and treasuries right after the announcement indicate that the market is concerned about the economy deteriorating, but today it looks like it's a different story. The market's actions immediately after the Fed announcement tend to be erratic and irrational. Another analyst wrote that on Fed days under Powell, there have been clear negative bias for equities in the final hours of trading, which is again on display yesterday. The truth is that this is all conjecture, opinion, people throwing out their thoughts. The real truth of the matter is we don't know. We don't know why the market ended the day yesterday in the red and is in the green today. Like I've said repeatedly, overall interest rates going down is mathematically beneficial for stocks. Every investment has a relative value based on other opportunities. Investing is not in a vacuum. Equities are not the only thing that you can buy as an investor. When interest rates go down, it makes other alternative investments like bonds and cash, money market funds, CDs, less attractive, and stocks, relatively speaking, more attractive. So it makes sense that the market goes up after a rate cut. The only counter narrative is if the economy goes into a recession. Equities take on more risks during recessions. So investors right now are trying to balance the risk of holding equities and the chance of us going into a recession. But lucky for us, recessions during rate cuts are not necessarily guaranteed. And Jeremy Siegel is an economist and investor that believes there's a good chance we can avoid a recession. This was the best news I've heard from the Fed in years. And by the way, let me guarantee you an all time high for the stock market today. There's not going to be a back and forth the way there is yesterday. And the word recalibration is is extremely significant. I think what they did is look at they said, listen, we're 100 percent towards our target unemployment. We've got that back to normal. We're 80 to 100 percent depending on what data you use on inflation. And we haven't moved at all until yesterday on the Fed funds. We say that the neutral Fed funds is 2.9 percent. And why aren't we closer? We're now thinking about that gap, which is exactly what I talked about a month ago. Jeremy Siegel believes that this is the best news the Fed could deliver, that they're not worrying about the gradual approach of slowly lowering interest rates down to this target. He says, mind the gap, that there's a large gap between where we are now and neutral. Neutral from the Fed standpoint is 2.9 percent. We're currently around 4.7 percent. So we have a ways to go to get to that neutral stance. And I think he's certainly correct about more interest rates coming in the future. Now, of course, whenever the Fed is on a path of cutting interest rates like this, investors are not only concerned about combating the growth in unemployment. They're also concerned about reigniting inflation. We have a bit of shell shock from the level of inflation we just went through. And the last thing this country needs is to reignite inflation again. Inflation shows any signs of picking up and the Fed says, hold off, we're not going to do anything else anymore. That's correct. But I don't see any sign of inflation picking up. I mean, I took a look at the markets, the oil markets, you know, all those markets going ahead. And, you know, this Jeff Gunlock was on right afterwards. He said his model actually shows a year over year inflation next year when those shelter new shelter numbers come in, it's going to fall below 2 percent. Now, I don't know if that's going to be the case, but that's certainly it's not a situation where the you know, we're off to the races again. The commodity markets, those sensitive markets, they tell you when you're off to the races. They told me in 2020, 2021, it's a totally different picture today. Cutting interest rates is unlikely to spur inflation once again, because we're not doing the thing we did a couple years ago originally to cause inflation. Inflation wasn't just caused by supply chain disruptions. It was caused by record levels, trillions of dollars being handed out to people. When you create more demand through stimulus while simultaneously having a shutdown with supply chains, that's obviously going to spur a lot of inflation. We're not giving out record levels of stimulus anymore, and supply chains are back on track. Neither contributing factor that caused inflation originally exists today. So it's unnecessary for the Federal Reserve to keep their interest rates as high as they were when they were combating that inflation. Now, of course, I'm not saying that there's no inflation. There's always going to be a low amount of inflation, two to three percent. That's on any given year. And our government does that to lower the value of our staggering amounts of debt. So we should expect a constant amount of low inflation. And the assets that we invest in help protect us against that inflation. But overall, I think Jeremy Siegel is correct that we're not facing hyperinflation. I don't think it's going to go back up like it was during 2020. And I think there's more reason to be bullish on this market. So as of right now, I'm excited. I'm staying invested and I'll continue to buy companies that I think represent good value. Now, moving on, we get to the news that Amazon continues to roll out generative AI based assistance and tools. For a company that's not a so-called AI company, Amazon really never gets grouped into that basket. It's usually Microsoft or Google. People avoid calling Amazon an AI company. And it sure seems like Amazon's coming out with a lot of AI tools for a not AI company. This latest one is a project codenamed Amelia. Amazon introduces this by saying that they've been investing in machine learning and AI for more than 25 years. More recently, advancements in generative AI have made it possible to deliver even more innovative experiences, including further simplifying selling in Amazon stores while providing more powerful avenues for growth. Now, again, this bot, Amelia, is not a customer facing bot. Customers don't see it. This is only for sellers on Amazon. And from what I can see, it's a trained bot on a large language model to look at your data and give you specific answers to questions about your store. You can ask it how your sales are doing or how your products are doing, what your click through rates, lots of different things about the analytics. This tool gives sellers the ability to just type stuff like, how's my business doing? And then it gives a bulleted point of the sales, units sold, selling price, the amount of traffic, the changes, month over month and year over year. And then it gives a plain text summary, adding commentary to how your business is doing. Overall, your business is doing well with impressive growth across key metrics like sales, unit, and traffic. While conversion rate could be optimized, the strong momentum positions you well for the upcoming holiday season. Now, of course, this is their demo and it's in beta right now. But if this thing runs anywhere close to like these demos, this is going to be a game changer to sellers. Not every seller on Amazon is a data analyst that can decipher all the metrics and determine the biggest things to focus on. So having an AI bot do that for you could be invaluable. Now, you know that I've been bullish on Amazon for a while. I really like the company, both from a customer perspective and from an investment standpoint. I still believe that Amazon is one of the more undervalued companies in the market, based on my assumptions of its long-term cash flow growth and terminal value. So when I see news like this today with the growing fundamentals of Amazon, it makes me more happy about the company. Now we move on to a story that's a bit more concerning if you're invested in the payment card networks like Visa and MasterCard. Apparently, Walmart is planning instant bank payments that would completely circumvent going through Visa and MasterCard. Walmart customers will soon have the option to pay directly from their bank account with instant transfers for online purchases. The enhanced feature is a flashpoint in the escalating tensions between the merchants and the card network setting the fees for payment processing. So basically, what they've done here is found a way to speed up the ACH transfer so it no longer has that two to three business days pending transaction. When the transaction processes at a real-time payment, customers get immediate access to see that payment come through. So they see the payment come through and then they know how much money they actually have. They have no pending transactions. Pending transactions can make it so customers get their payments confused and in many cases overdraft their accounts. Now the big question for me when reading this news of trying to circumvent Visa MasterCard is the rewards program. Using Visa MasterCard at merchants like Walmart is an essentially free way to get rewards from those purchases. You get two to three percent back on every purchase. Is Walmart going to make up for that loss in rewards? Is Walmart going to offer a separate reward program? Now as an investor of MasterCard, I think it's important to ask what the potential is for this in the future. If it is true that Walmart and other large retailers can completely surpass their networks, that's not good news for them. That's hundreds of billions of dollars of volume processed that MasterCard could potentially miss. But I think this will be much more difficult than Walmart expects. People really love their credit cards. It is difficult to pry a credit card from a user that's been using it for years. They want to use it on their transactions. They want to earn the points on the specific card that they've chosen. So this is some news where I put in the basket of keeping an eye on it. It is slow progressive news that could over time potentially deteriorate the moat of MasterCard, but as of right now it's just a headline. Now moving on, we get to the news that Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden, is jumping today. The stock is up big. In fact, if we look at it right now, it's up 8.83%. So a big day for this company after they reported their earnings. This is an exciting earnings for this company. They announced a delivery partnership with Uber Technologies. That's another company that I'm rather bullish on right now. And they signaled that they're succeeding at attracting cash-strapped consumers into their eateries. They say that this recovery led to them maintaining their full-year guidance despite a significant drop in customers in July. The deal between Olive Garden and Uber also signals that the restaurant chain is trying to expand its reach as it battles the spending pullback. Now, the thing that I look at with this is it's great to see that Darden is doing well. In many cases, people would look at this and they'd think, wow, I own Texas Roadhouse. Should I be concerned about this? A competitor is doing well compared to Texas Roadhouse? I don't think so. When I look at Darden Restaurant and I compare both the restaurant, the operations, the value proposition, the customer experience to Texas Roadhouse, I consider Texas Roadhouses as superior. I believe the value proposition is better at Texas Roadhouse. You get food that's considered to be higher quality, more expensive food. You're getting steaks instead of spaghetti. And typically, if you compare the dinner prices from one restaurant to another, you're also not paying much, if not any more at Texas Roadhouse. So in the minds of consumers, I still believe that Texas Roadhouse maintains the best value proposition amongst casual restaurants. But either way, when I'm looking at these companies and the bounce back in restaurants between Chili's and Darden, I consider that a good thing. I think it benefits Texas Roadhouse. It shows that customers right now are willing to go out and purchase experiences. And I believe Texas Roadhouse will continue to carve itself out as one of the top restaurants that people frequent. Now, finally, as tradition, typically on weekends, we look at people that are entrepreneurs, that are investors, that have somehow managed to make great returns doing something. We're going to look at how this individual became rich. So basically, I built a business using Airbnb and other people's properties to make money. And then I got a job at Deloitte as an investment banker. Deloitte is a world famous investment banking company. And I used my extra time because I built like a four hour work week business to get a job 40, 50, 60 hours a week. I don't hear of many people running businesses that require four hours a week to run. That seems like an incredible business. I'd probably just invest more time into expanding that business. If it's that efficient, you only need four hours a week to run it. Just spend more time in that thing. Anyway, it seems like he's not done here. Let's let him continue on. I use that 60 hours to generate money to do amazing things like this. And then actually what I'm doing at the moment is I'm negotiating a remote job with Deloitte so I can get a job at Ernst & Young and SwissBank so I can get multiple remote jobs going. And then I'm going to hire assistants overseas to do those jobs for me because I find all that stuff very complicated. He says he's going to use his free time after starting his business that requires four hours per week to run. He's going to use all the extra free time to get a job at Deloitte, which is one of the big massive big four firms in the US. So it's a big respectable firm. Getting a job there is not easy. Requires intense background checks and extensive interviewing processes to get a job at that firm. But then he also says he's going to simultaneously interview and get a job at Ernst & Young, which is another one of the big four firms in the US, which again requires an extensive application process, interview process, background checks, all of that stuff. Those are two of the big four firms in the US. And then he says he's also going to get a third job at the Swiss bank, which is a term to refer to any of the big banks over there, which of course have their own extensive interview processes. Somehow he's going to get a job and get accepted at all three of these companies. But not only that, he says once he has the job, he's going to outsource it. Uh, assistants overseas to do those jobs for me because I find all of that stuff very complicated. Apparently overseas assistants can easily do these jobs, even though he says that they're complicated. If there's any trend that really needs to die, it's the one where someone stands next to something that's kind of sort of impressive or something that's kind of expensive and then rattles off a bunch of nonsense things while they're standing next to it. In this case, the individual is on a boat with three women in the background. That is that that's what he's doing that's so impressive. That's supposed to get you to buy in to what he's saying. Does he know the women? Who knows? Is this boat his? Probably not. But that's supposed to be enough to convince you to buy into whatever garbage he's selling. I think we need to do better. More people need to call this stuff out. More people need to mock it because of how ridiculous it is. And hopefully we can change this in the future. Hopefully we can make this type of nonsense less prevalent. That's going to be it for this episode. I hope you enjoyed and I'll see you in the next one.\n",
      "F:\\cc_data\\yt_data\\The_Stock_Market_Has_Become_Overvalued.mp3 The_Stock_Market_Has_Become_Overvalued\n",
      " Today on the Joseph Carlson Show, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 are both up 20% year-to-date, and that is after racing up in 2023. In just the past five years, the S&P 500 is up double. The QQQ is up 155%. Many top stocks, like the ones in my portfolio, have also done really well. They've raced up to all-new highs. And while it's nice to look at this and see the gains come in, it's also important to ask whether or not these companies are getting expensive. So today we're going to be looking at that question of the valuation of the stock market. We'll be looking at price-to-sales multiples, PE ratios, forward-looking indicators of the major market. We'll also be getting the opinions on different commentators of why they think the market is cheap or expensive. For example, Dan Niles believes the market is expensive. While you contrast that with both Tom Lee and Ed Yardini, who both believe the market will continue going up. So we'll be going over all of that, and I'll be giving some thoughts on what I'm doing specifically knowing that my portfolio is becoming more expensive. Now we also have news of the China trade. Chinese stocks are doing well after the Chinese government has promised to do incredible levels of stimulus, in many ways trying to mimic what the U.S. economy did. Many of the top Chinese stocks, like Alibaba, have surged over the past month. So it raises the question of whether or not we should try to take advantage of this stimulus. Is the government in China handing out free money that investors can scoop up? Or is it better to steer clear? Now we also have news of one of the most impactful strikes happening right now, led by this guy, wearing apparently $1,000 worth glasses and a $10,000 gold chain. He is the one striking for a big pay increase. And then finally, we have news that Meta's AI glasses are quickly being used to dox people live. We'll look into how this works and why I believe eventually these AI glasses will be used by the police. Now, obviously, we have a lot to get to in this episode. One quick mention before we jump in. It is the beginning of the month, which means that if you sign up for the Patreon, patreon.com slash Joseph Carlson, you will get access to Qualtrum, which is this website. It's the stock analysis tool I use all the time. I've built it from the ground up. Qualtrum has all the financial statements in visual format. It has KPIs. These are unique things like Costco warehouses over time and other specific key performance indicators per company. It also has a watch list page that shows you how your companies are trading, shows which ones are currently in a dip. You can read earnings transcripts from every company. You simply just type in the stock and you have it right there in message format. The reason I bring it up is because if you join today, you'll get the entire month of October for free. It says $10 a month, but that is after a one month trial. We're getting close to 7,000 active users on it and it continues to grow. We keep investing more and more into it. So try that out if you like. Now let's go ahead and move on and jump into the main story, which is that the market is getting up to near what I consider to be the expensive territory. You can call it expensive. You can call it overbought. You can call it overvalued. Whatever you want to call it, I think it all virtually means the same thing. The market is towards that category where there's higher expectations for companies than what normal is. I have $1,100. That is all dividend money and I want to deploy that cash. I want to reinvest it, but where should I put it? Well, there's a couple of different thought processes of what to do in the situation where everything is seemingly looking overvalued and we have new money to deploy. Now, the first question we have to answer is if everything really is overvalued. We can do that by looking at historical averages. For example, this chart shows the S&P 500 in blue and the QQQ in purple. This is a chart of their forward price to earnings ratio over time. For example, we can look back in 2012 and 2013, buying stocks during this time period where they're at an average PE ratio of 13 was super cheap. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. You could not miss. Now, over time, stock valuations and forward PE ratios of the overall indices started to go up, but rather slowly. From 2014 to 2020, they went from around a 13 forward PE ratio to around an 18. But then after COVID happened and record stimulus was pumped into the economy, people started paying anything for stocks. They were buying them hand over fist. They couldn't pay enough for them. Even companies that didn't have fundamentals to back them up. The S&P 500 got up to a 25 forward PE and the QQQ to a 30. So an average of around a 27 forward PE ratio. So we have both ends of the spectrum here. Now, we know what happens after paying too much for something. The stock started to trade down. They re-rated. Many of the most expensive companies in the market went down. This was in conjunction with the decline of ARK Innovations ETF. Those type of funds were the ones that were the most severely damaged during this time period. Now, there has since been a recovery from when it met its lows, and that's where we find ourselves today. Today, the QQQ is at a 25 forward PE ratio. The S&P 500 is at a 22 forward PE ratio. So if you blended the two together, we're at around a 23 forward PE ratio. So the question is whether or not a 23 forward PE ratio is too expensive. One investor, Dan Niles, believes the answer to that question is yes. And he argues that instead of US investors doing well, the trade now is to move to China. But yeah, I want to get longer China as we go forward, because if this is a fundamental shift in their way of thinking, we've seen what stimulus does in every other country on the planet. Unless you think a global pandemic is great for the world, the S&P shouldn't have been up 16% in 2020. So you know what stimulus can already do. And China has just refused to do it. He makes a pretty straightforward argument, and I would say even a compelling argument. But there's other investors that believe it's not time to abandon the US markets. That's right. I think we're still in the midst of a very tricky period, because we've got the election in less than 35 days. And now we've got two things that investors don't know how to discount. One is, you know, mounting tensions in the Middle East, and then a port strike that is potentially going to cripple the economy. And so I think that as investors worry about this, if we get a dip, and a big dip, I think you still want to buy that dip because the setup into your end has a lot of tailwinds. Tom believes that one of the big tailwinds is other investors buying the dip. Simply put, there's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines. And he's mentioned this for the past couple of years. Anytime there's a big dip in the market, investors will dip into their money market accounts and buy the dip. He also believes the S&P 500 could reach 6,000 by the end of the year, which is around $300 to $400 higher than it is today. Ed Yardini also believes there's a good setup for the market to race higher. I raised the odds of a just outright melt up like something we had in the 1990s. I've been talking about it only a 20% probability and I'm raising that to 30%. And then I still have 50% in what I call the roaring 2020s. So that's 80% that we're in a bull market. The 20% I kind of leave for a 1970 scenario as a result of geopolitical risk. So he factors in the geopolitical risks, but still believes there's an 80% chance of the market going higher. And I must say, when I look at these different takes, I agree with Ed Yardini and Tom Lee. I disagree with Dan Niles in jumping into the China trade. And it seems like the media is trying to push me that direction. In fact, when I look at different outlets like Bloomberg, it highlights over and over again, the Chinese stimulus, Chinese stocks soaring more than 7%. We see it talked about nonstop on CNBC. All these investors jumping into Chinese equities. Barron's is another outlet that's made a lot of their top stock picks for 2024, Chinese stocks. And so far, those ones have done really well. They say that the China trade is still thriving. It's easy to understand the logic behind this trade. US stocks are looking expensive. Chinese stocks look cheap. And China is now doing stimulus. And this is something that there's a heavily split opinion on. David Tepper, one of the legendary fund managers, just said a couple days ago to quote, buy everything in China. Now when you have somebody as respectable as David Tepper saying this, obviously that stirs a lot of opinions. So now there's a lot of traders rushing into buy China. Even so, I'm not following this trade. And I don't think anybody explains the risks better than Kyle Bass, someone that's been continually right on the risks of investing in China for years. Yeah, great to be here, Andrew. I think that look, Tepper is one of the best hedge fund investors in the history of our markets. And he's a great trader. And, you know, we say something at our firm, we say, you know, you can't break your arm jumping out of the basement window. Chinese stocks have been up only five of the last 20 years. Their GDP is up 505% reportedly. And if you invested in their Shanghai Shenzhen 300 index 15 years ago, you're still not making money, even though stocks are up 25% in just a week. So you've got a policy driven stimulus, you've got animal spirits arisen. But typically, the biggest rallies are counter trend rallies. And China's trend has just been down for so many years, Andrew, as they've shown their, as Xi Jinping has kind of shown his hand, investing in communism has never worked in the long run. So your argument is your argument. Now he's interrupted there. But the end of that exchange, he says that investing in communism has never worked in the long run. And that is one of the biggest problems with China is the level of distrust with the way that they run their government. For example, one of the things that caused a lot of concerns investing in Alibaba was Jack Ma going missing after criticizing the Chinese government publicly in an interview. Those type of things do not build trust in the government. And Kyle Bass is correct in giving the track record of China. There's no other way to say it than Chinese stocks have been a terrible investment for a long period of time. Here's a chart of the Chinese large cap ETF going back to 2004. Now it starts off in 2004, it goes up in a big rally up until 2007. And then it falls. But unlike the US where it recovered and continually grew throughout time, investors did really well for the next 20 years, the Chinese large cap ETF today is still below half of where it was in 2007. And it's not just 2007. It's also well below where it was in 2021 or 2018, 2014, 2010. This has been a bad investment for the past 20 years. Now you could argue that maybe this is the time to buy. It's been so low for so long, you're getting these stocks at a great deal. But he also doesn't believe that that's the case. They got they got stocks up. Think about this, Andrew, 25% in one week. And so is that a good time to buy something? I would I would argue that this has been a trading rally. It's been a massive counter trend rally. But you know, like think about 2014, think about many years before their stock market sits today, where it was a year ago, where it was in 2016, where it was in 2009, where it was in 2006. That's exactly where we sit today. And so if their GDP is up 505%, and you're still sitting where you were sitting back in 2006, I don't know, maybe you shouldn't consider not investing in communism. Do you do I think that the rally could continue? Do I think that stocks can go up more? The answer is yes, but I equate it to picking up dimes in front of bulldozers. Investors can pick whatever side they want on this. But Kyle Bass has the historical data to support his argument. Anytime Chinese stocks have surge, that's been quickly followed by them going nowhere for a long period of time. So in many ways, this feels like that meme where you're deciding between two choices, one of them being overpriced US stocks or China stocks. A difficult choice, but even given this scenario, where you're looking at stock prices in the US and feeling like they're a little expensive, I'd still rather make that choice. I still think the risk and reward is better. First of all, it's debatable how overpriced US stocks really are. That all depends on future growth. In many cases, stocks can outgrow expectations to a huge extent. That's why when we actually look at most data of the S&P 500, if you bought it during market highs, during time periods where it just broke all time highs, you actually did quite well. In fact, you did better buying the market at all time highs, rather than investing on any average day. That's because you're buying the market during times of momentum. And this is the reverse psychology that gets a lot of investors in trouble. It's better if we disconnect from all anchoring bias, if instead of focusing on how much stocks have gone up, we focus on buying quality companies that still have a very bright future. So the answer of whether or not I'm investing in Chinese stocks is no. I think Chinese people are great. They're hardworking and trustworthy. But unfortunately, the system of government is not one that I can put my trust behind with large amounts of capital. And in terms of what specific companies I'm buying, that's where things get really difficult. Right now in my portfolio, there's not any company on any significant dip. So there's no easy buy in the portfolio. And in situations like this, what I plan on doing is simply just waiting a little, I'm going to try to accumulate a little bit more cash through both dividends and deposits, and wait until earnings season. Typically an earnings season out of the 12 companies in this portfolio, a couple of them will have some negative earnings reaction and go down a few percentage points. If that happens, that'll be a buying opportunity to deploy these dividends. Now moving on, we get to news that you've heard about all week. It's the port strikes from Maine to Texas. The ports are where you ship in those large shipping containers. It's part of our logistics chain. It's part of our supply chain. It's what moves things around from one continent to another. And while these are being shut down, that causes inflation. Inflation is when you have more demand for something than supply. So having a strike at the ports reduces supply and increases demand, causing inflation in almost everything. From common goods to oil to all sorts of commodities, every single thing you can think of starts to become more expensive because of these strikes. So this is something that's not a small strike. It's not like something that we can just ignore. This is going to have a real impact on a lot of people. The country is going to be worse off from it. There's new analysis coming out that's saying the port strikes could reignite inflation. Economic impacts are dependent on how long it lasts. Christopher Ball says if it goes for a week or two, you're running into businesses that have real shortages. And yeah, they'll absolutely have to raise those prices just to prevent broad shortages of those goods. And of course, this happens right after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points. The worst thing that could happen for the Federal Reserve is for inflation to start trending back up. That could potentially impact the soft landing they're looking for. So we know it's at stake here. This isn't something that's going to completely shut down the economy. People shouldn't be entirely fearful because of these strikes. There's still other ports that are open right now. But this does impact the economy in a negative way. It raises prices across the board, and it could reignite inflation to some degree. None of that is good for the US, for customers, for investors. Now, this is also a story where, unfortunately, the more that you read about this and the more that you research it, you just become more and more upset at why they're striking and specifically what they're asking for. This is one of those stories where just the more you dive into it, the more irritating it becomes. First of all, the guy behind the strike is the leader of the International Longshoremen's Association. His name is Harold Daggett. Now, we'll talk about Harold here in just a minute. But I first want to go over what they're asking. This is from the Wall Street Journal. So this is vetted. This is specifically from the union. This is what they're actually asking. And I have to preface that because of how ridiculous it is. Daggett rejected an offer late Monday of a 50% wage increase over six years. A boost from an earlier proposed 40% wage increase. That's correct. He already rejected an offer of a 50% wage increase over a six-year period. Now we go on to what they want. And this is where things just get mind-blowing. The ILA, which is the International Longshoremen Association, want to raise the base hourly rate for its roughly 45,000 members from $39 per hour to $69. So they're wanting to raise their base rate for every single member and every single role. Now, know that not all of them do the same job. So some of them have less difficult jobs than others, but they want to raise it from roughly $40 per hour, which is almost six figures per year, to $70 per hour, which is well in excess of $100,000 per year based on full-time work. That is a 77% pay increase over six years. So they're shutting down part of logistics, part of U.S. commerce, threatening to reignite inflation to get a pay increase. This is essentially holding the U.S. hostage to get a massive pay increase. And this is where we have a problem with some unions. Unions are meant to protect exploited workers. Workers that are disadvantaged, being taken advantage of by large corporations that don't have a voice themselves. So there's a union that helps represent them and barter for their good. But unions aren't supposed to be a mechanism whereby a large organization can extort the rest of the country into giving themselves massive above-market pay increases. A big part of the issue here is that a lot of that 77% increase in pay would go to workers already making well in excess of $100,000 per year. These are already well-paid workers wanting to make almost double. Now, like I said, we'd be hearing more about Harold Daggett in a minute. He is the leader of this union. The one's already turned down two different generous offers for pay increases, and he's going for that 77% pay increase. Here's what he has to say regarding the strike. Are you worried that this strike is going to hurt the everyday American, the farmers that need to reach the export market? They're telling me that they're going to hurt through all of this. Now you start to realize who the longshoremen are, right? Nobody cares about us. People never gave a s*** about us until now, when they finally realized that the chain is being broke now. Cars won't come in. Food won't come in. Clothing won't come in. You know how many people depend on our jobs? Half the world. He says that people never cared about us until now, which in a way is true. I guess people aren't actively thinking about port workers on a daily basis. That's not something that you normally wake up and go, wow, I really care about the port workers today. But it's not a normal thing for people to do with any industry. No matter what job you're working, not everyone in the world is focused on the job that you're doing, no matter how integral it is to the economy. People think about what he's doing, obviously, because they're compensating him and the union members for doing it. Many of them making above $100,000 per year. And further, if we look at this interview in and of itself, this union leader himself exemplifies greed in every way possible. For example, we have the detectives at TikTok. One of them pointing out that in his interviews, he's wearing glasses that have a very unique band. Around that band, you can identify what type of glasses they are. They are 24-karat gold-plated rimless butterfly sunglasses that retail for $1,245. On his neck, he also has a chain. That chain is a 14-karat yellow gold railroad chain necklace. It retails for around $10,000. This union leader, while pretending to be taken advantage of, is apparently blinged out in high fashion. Now, you could say, hey, Joseph, maybe he's just one of those people that has expensive tastes and likes having a few nice things that he saved up a long time period for. Well, that could have been the case. But as people looked more into the life of this union leader, claiming that he's going to shut down the economy, hurt American people, cause inflation, all for a 77% pay increase, well, it turns out that he's not someone that just likes high fashion. He just has a lot of money. He owns a 7,000 square foot mansion. This mansion is located on a 10-acre property in Sparta, a leafy enclave 50 miles west of New York City. It encircles a spacious backyard patio with a pool. It's difficult to really visualize what a 7,000 square foot mansion looks like, so we get an aerial view to see it better. And you can see the eloquence, the expansiveness, the impressiveness of this property. I will say one thing. This union leader has good taste. This is an impressive house that anyone would be envious of. This is a property that, according to Zillow, is worth at least $6 million. Now again, this is all owned by a guy that just recently said in an interview, quote, I will cripple you. I will cripple you, and you have no idea what that means. Nobody does. The Wall Street Journal reported that when he was asked how long the strikes would last, he said, quote, I don't have an effing crystal ball between my legs, but it will last for very long. I would tell you that. So this union's led by someone that has extravagant taste for wealth and shows his bling while in interviews advocating for his union members to have nearly double in pay, many of them making over $100,000 per year already. And they're not only asking for a pay increase, they're also demanding that we can't automate our ports. Port automation is exactly what it sounds like. We use robots to make ports automated. They're safer, they're more efficient, they work harder, and they're cheaper. And we have ports already doing this in California. Our Stu Mundell over the port of Los Angeles seeing something unfold many folks probably didn't know about. The port is going automated. Artificial intelligence and digital technology are moving and powering commerce here. These are drones. Containers are lowered onto trailers, and within seconds those trucks drive off. They know where to turn, where to drive, and where to drop off their cargo. They even yield to each other when one crosses in front of the other, and there are no humans in sight. Obviously, this is really cool. Seeing ports automated like this is awesome. But the union on strike right now doesn't like this. They don't like it one bit, and in fact, they're demanding that you can't do this with the ports they work out. On a side note, the automated ports that China has been developing are so much more efficient that they work for a fraction of the cost while getting more done. And more importantly, they run 24-7, unlike US ports that have to stop whenever the employees go home. These ports continue working, which means that people can ship things in at any hour of the day. So as I said, this is one of those stories that the more I learned about the topic, the more it becomes frustrating to understand what they're really asking for. 77% increase in pay for a leader that is a multi-millionaire and already makes $800,000 per year. And while wanting that pay increase, they're also demanding that the US cannot innovate and develop further automation on their ports. How long will this strike last? How much damage will it cost? Right now, we don't know. But so far, it's not looking good. Now moving on, we get to the story that we know Meta has been developing augmented reality glasses. This is one of the groundbreaking changes they came out with, a new platform, as Mark Zuckerberg calls it. But there's been somewhat of a problem or a potential side effect of their already existing Ray-Ban sunglasses. And that is that people have used them in combination of other techniques to instantaneously dox people in real life. To use it, you just put the glasses on. Then as you walk by people, the glasses will detect when somebody's face is in frame. This photo is used to analyze them. And after a few seconds, their personal information pops up on your phone. This is me, right? Jun Lee, right? You're from Bergen County Academies? Yeah. Your Korean name is Jun Yoon? So basically, they just wrote a simple program where the glasses are constantly scanning people because they have a live video feed. Once they get a clear enough image, it detects the face, it plugs it into AI. Then within a couple seconds, you know everything about this person's history. Now, obviously, this can be done in private locations and public locations. It can be done in businesses without you knowing. As long as someone's wearing sunglasses and they just look at you, they could potentially know everything about you, everything that's publicly online, or even things deep in your past buried online somewhere throughout the web. They say that privacy has always been a major concern with smart glasses. Google Glass originally failed due in part to public backlash at being recorded without consent in public places. Now, Meta tried to address this by including a privacy light that automatically turns on whenever you're recording video. So that was Meta's big solution. They're saying, oh, people are concerned that they're going to be recorded all the time and they don't like that invasion of privacy. Well, we'll just turn on a little light on the frame of the glasses whenever it's recording because people will never figure out how to turn that light off or how to simply cover it. Another problem with that light is it's incredibly difficult to notice when you're outside in bright light. So you can simply be outside and most people are still not going to even notice a tiny little LED light on. Although they're cool and it's a new innovative platform that Meta's leaning heavily into, this is another erosion of our general privacy. We know that everything we do whenever we go outside is going to be recorded. It's going to be looked up in databases. There's going to be facial recognition technology used against us. Another big use case I believe will happen from this is police force. I think the police will be very interested in having glasses that anytime they look at anyone, it IDs who they're looking at. It looks up all of their historical information and then they could integrate that into a background check. They could see all their priors while just looking at their face. So whether or not Meta wants to work with the police, whether or not they decide to, eventually someone's going to. So while I see this as another big platform, I think there is huge advantages to augmented reality. I also think there's going to be some severe disadvantages. But those are just my thoughts. We'll see how things develop. That's all for now. See you in the next one.\n",

      " Today on the Joseph Carlson Show, we finally got through the second week of earnings season. This one was jam-packed with some more popular companies reporting earnings like Tesla. But many of the companies in my portfolio also reported earnings this week, Texas Roadhouse being one of them. It's up around 2.8% after reporting earnings. This company's on fire. It's one that seemingly can't miss. We'll be diving into Texas Roadhouse's report and what's driving this company further. We also have two other notable companies that have reported earnings this week, both Moody's Corporation and S&P Global. I own both of these companies. The credit rating agencies are proving once again why they're considered highly profitable duopolies. We're going to take a peek at their earnings and see what happened this quarter. We have one company in my portfolio that I've decided I'm going to sell. It's just a matter of time. Canadian Pacific once again reported their earnings and I'll be going over what's causing me to move out of this company. And then finally, the middle of this week, we had Tesla report their earnings. This was a crucial report for Tesla. The stock needed to move. This company needed momentum. And Elon Musk with Tesla hit the ball out of the park. Tesla stock is up 20% on the week, bringing this company back into the green year to date. This is a fantastic report. And I'll be going over what I think was both the most important part of the earnings report and the most important things that Elon Musk mentioned in the call. Now, right after this earnings report, in fact, just a couple days later, Elon Musk is celebrating the stock moving up. Tesla investors are celebrating. And then the Wall Street Journal drops a hit piece on Elon Musk titled Elon Musk's Secret Conversations with Vladimir Putin. The title of this article sounds very scandalous, but is there anything to it? Well, I did something that most people don't do when they look at an article with this type of title. I read it. I actually read through the article. So I'll be going over how scandalous these secret conversations really were. And then finally, today marks a big day for Microsoft. They're dropping a brand new Call of Duty title. This one is Black Ops 6. This is one of their first AAA fully fledged games that's going to be offered on their subscription tier. We'll be looking over Microsoft's gaming future in this change of strategy. So we have a lot to get to in this episode. Let's go ahead and start off. This week is earnings week number two. We kicked off earnings week number one with the only big company being Netflix. Netflix is always one of the first to report every earnings season. And it's extra exciting for Netflix because you get a lot of eyes on this stock. It's usually highly volatile. And this time it was no different. Netflix stock rose 11% after their earnings beat. The report was solid from top to bottom. And it set the tone going into earnings season. Netflix was one of the first tests of this earnings season, and it gave a green light to investors. Investors bought up more of the company as they could see this was a valuable and growing asset. But here we are capping off week two. A lot of other notable companies, both ones that are in my portfolio, have reported. And to give you an idea of what I'm doing currently, I'm sitting with my portfolio, enjoying the gains that happened over the past couple of weeks. But I'm also sitting with around $2,000 in cash. All of this cash comes from dividends. You'll know when you're building up a portfolio, a lot of the companies that are really good companies that generate a lot of extra cash, they tend to pay dividends over time. If they're really good companies, they'll continually grow that dividend as well. That's what my portfolio does for the most part. And you can see that a lot of these familiar names are paying hefty dividends. Now in many brokerages, people will opt to have those dividends reinvested back into the company that paid them. In my case, I choose not to do that. Instead, I want that money to go back into the cash balance to form a nice pile of cash. And then I can wait patiently for which company I want to buy. And earnings season is a time of waiting patiently. I look at my companies go through earnings season, I see if any company that I want to own more of has a bad earnings report. Or better yet, they have a good earnings report, but sell off anyway. But so far, I'm struggling to find any great company that's had a great earnings report that's selling off anyway. Right now, investors are in buying mode, and they're buying the dip on almost any company. Now as we go through this week, one of the companies that just keeps winning is Texas Roadhouse. I've talked about this one a lot, but that's because I'm following the remarkable performance of this company. One of the best decisions I've made all year long is not selling a single share of Texas Roadhouse. There was a debate of whether or not we should take gains early this year, as even holding this company in 2023 led to a great return. But so far in 2024 alone, Texas Roadhouse is up 57%. The company pays a yield of around another 3%. So Texas Roadhouse's total returns for the year are near 60%. To give you an idea of how remarkable that performance is, if Texas Roadhouse was in the S&P 500, which right now it's not, but if it were, this company would be a top 20 performing company this year. It's beat out so many different tech companies and familiar names that you hear about all the time online. It's doubled and tripled the performance of many great tech companies. And yet you don't hear about this one that much. In fact, looking at videos from CNBC and their coverage, live TV, different YouTube channels, you're not going to hear about companies like this because of their very small market cap. Most investors are paying attention to much larger companies. So even though this one continues to have remarkable performance, it doesn't get a lot of attention paid. Now looking at the most recent quarter, it was as good as ever from this company. They posted $1.26 in earnings per share the most recent quarter, which is a growth rate of 32% year over year. The earnings per share on a trailing 12 month basis gives us a bit more of a smooth view. We have a bigger window. And even on a trailing 12 month basis on its most recent Q3 quarter, it grew by 34%, $5.82. And that is because even with restaurants, companies that aren't known for their operating leverage or scale, when they do meet certain critical mass points, they do have some operating leverage. Texas Roadhouse is seeing that in their business. They have a lot of efficiencies of scale that they've accomplished over the past couple of years. When we move over to the revenue, this looks good as well. It grew to $1.27 billion in the most recent quarter. That's 13.48%. They generated $56 million in cash, where last year during the same quarter, they only generated $13 million. The number of Texas Roadhouse restaurants continues to grow. It grew 7% year over year. Average weekly sales is one of the most important things that restaurants track. If we look at the total weekly sales every single week, they average 149,000, a 7.5% increase year over year. Texas Roadhouse increased their to-go orders by 10.8%. It's really good to see growth in their to-go orders. If you haven't ever ordered from Texas Roadhouse to-go, they have streamlined this process. They have a window in the back of the restaurant where you go and pick it up. They have reserved parking. They have incredibly good to-go packaging. They package the meals with a lot of care. It's one of the better experiences. And then in terms of forecasts of the future, they do give us a little bit of an outlook for next year, saying that they do expect positive comparable restaurant sales growth, including the benefit of price increases. They increase prices rather slowly, only 1% or 2% price increases at a time. But those small percentages do add up and then store weekly growth of approximately 5%. Their CapEx expenditures are going up to $400 million as they continue to open up new restaurants. So we have a positive outlook as well. Now, anytime a stock goes up 60% in a single year, there's always a debate over what to do with this position. Investors have benefited greatly, and this starts creating discussions of taking gains, of the company becoming overvalued. Any time a stock moves up this quickly, there's always that discussion. In my case, when I look at the valuation of Texas Roadhouse, there is no doubt that the multiples have expanded. When I was first buying the company, it was trading closer to a 20 PE ratio. So it was much cheaper on a PE basis. Now it's getting up to the 26 range, the 27, the multiples are expanding, and I'm benefiting from that multiple expansion. Another thing I can look at here is on a free cash flow basis. I remember that this top line here, when I first bought the company, was over 4%. So I was getting at a much better deal on its trailing free cash flows. The company is becoming a little bit more expensive for what you're paying for. Now, this can't go on to an infinite degree. Texas Roadhouse has an appropriate multiple it should trade for, but I still don't think the company is at that price point where I want to sell. From what I look at right now, between the multiples the company trades at, and the earnings growth of this company, the continued revenue growth, their capital return policy, I like everything I see. I'm going to hang on to this company as both the fundamentals and the valuation leave me no compelling reason to sell the company as of now. Next, we had Moody's and S&P Global. The two credit rating duopolies report their earnings this week. I won't go into the details of these ones other than saying that everything came in basically in It was business as usual for both of these companies. Moody's beat on their revenue and earnings per share estimates. S&P Global beat on their revenue and their earnings per share estimates. Both of these companies raised their guidance for the full year. Both of these companies traded down slightly after earnings. Now, you might ask, why are these companies trading down when they beat on their earnings and raised guidance? Well, there's a lot of reasons for that, but the biggest culprit typically is investors' expectations. Investors' expectations drive results in earnings. And investors and Moody's are already expecting predictable earnings. Moody's Corporation and S&P Global both trade at elevated valuations over the S&P 500. Moody's is at a 36 Ford PE, a 2.7% free cash flow yield. S&P Global is at a 29 and a 2.9. So both of these companies are slightly more elevated in their valuation than most other quality companies. But even so, another thing I'll mention about these companies is that they trade up ahead of earnings almost every time. So when I zoom out over the full year, we have a company here that's up 22%, paying dividends every single quarter, and growing their earnings per share and free cash flow per share. This is exactly the type of investments we want to make. S&P Global likewise has had a decent year. It's up 13%, not quite as good as the market this year. So we see a little bit of underperformance. But when we back out to the full year, that makes more sense. It's up 42% on a one year basis. Don't get discouraged by looking at the stock price trading around and ebbing and flowing week by week. Look at the overall fundamentals. These companies are growing dramatically. So right now I have a $100,000 position in S&P Global. I'm holding every share, not trimming any. I have a $46,000 position in Moody's and likewise not selling a single share. Now if we go to a company that I am planning on selling eventually, it's Canadian Pacific. Don't get me wrong. Canadian Pacific is a great company. Qualitatively, it has a dominant moat. It has a network effect. It has a network that goes from Canada all the way to Mexico. They're building bridges. They're doing lots of investments for the future. Overall, it's a great company. And so in no part of this am I trying to convince you that you need to sell this company if you hold it or that it's going to be a company that performs poorly in the future. I actually think that Canadian Pacific, although it's been flat over the past year, it's not going to remain flat forever. This company will buy back shares. It will pay dividends. It'll increase its stock price over time as they grow their free cash flow. The reason that I'm strongly considering selling Canadian Pacific over the next three months is simply because I believe I can find better companies. Ones that will grow a little faster. Ones that will give me a little bit more upside in the stock. When I look at my portfolio and my ability in stock picking, I notice some strengths and weaknesses. When we go into the real estate category, I've done okay there. I've made gains. But the real estate category has never been my strongest performing segment. And when I look at industrials, this is another category that I'm not having the best results. The companies that I've picked in the industrial category have done okay. I made a couple thousand dollars in Union Pacific, but I'm only up $600 in Canadian Pacific. I've held this company for over a year. And my analysis on these companies can only go so deep. Where I find myself having the best results are the companies and industries that are more in my wheelhouse. I know Costco inside out. I know every aspect of this company. With Booking Holdings, it's another type of company that I feel very familiar with. These large tech companies that are network effect platform companies. I feel very comfortable doing analysis in them. And so far, I've had good gains in these type of stocks. Large network effect tech companies have been my specialty for a while. If I look at my results in companies like Big Tech, the ones that I've been emphasizing investments in for the past five years, these have done exceptionally well. Buying and holding them at the right time, I view my performance in them above average. These are the companies that I feel I know the most in, I can do the deepest analysis of, and have the highest conviction in. And I've also had by far the best results in these type of companies. So rather than focusing on diversification for the sake of diversifying, feeling like I need to have a holding in an industrial company, I feel like my performance overall would be better if all of my capital was located into the type of companies I know the best. So don't be shocked at all if you see me exit out of this company over the next three months. What I'm waiting for is a dip in one of my watchlist companies. Now moving on down the week, we get to the most important earnings report of the week by far, which was Tesla. And they knocked it out of the park. Elon Musk added $30 billion to his net worth in a single day, as Tesla stock went up over 20% after earnings. Now I've said many times that stocks trade up after earnings for all different reasons. Sometimes they're justified, sometimes they're not. This is one of the cases where I believe this upwards move is justified. Tesla investors have meaningful reason to be more bullish on the future. I liked almost everything in this report. And I say almost because there's a couple things you could slightly nitpick. For example, the revenue growth was a little slow, 7.8%. So a little on the slower side, most of the companies I hold, I'm trying to get revenue growth above 10%. But even so this was headed in the right direction. So not too bad. There's a couple metrics that are far more meaningful for Tesla. For example, the earnings per share growth, we saw 17% earnings per share growth, we have free cash flow growth that also finally headed in the right direction. This is reverting a downward trend. This year, the free cash flow is up over 200% over the previous year. If we look at this on a trailing 12 month basis, you can see the reversal in trend. The free cash flows were headed down, they hit a bottom over the past two quarters, and then they're finally spiking back upwards. Tesla needs to move the free cash flow back up to this $8 billion mark to get the valuation back in the right place. The cash balance is also incredible. They have $33 billion in cash, which is very different than most automotive companies. Most automotive companies are swamped with debt. They have high amounts of leverage. Tesla is unique in the amount of cash they hold. Gross margins ticked up last quarter. They went from 17.95%, so roughly 18%, up to almost 20%. So a nice 2% increase quarter over quarter for the gross margins. That's another checkmark for Tesla to finally have the margins bottom out and head back up in the right direction. We can see the same thing in the operating margins. This is one of my biggest criticisms for this company going back a couple years ago. They had operating margins of 19%, 17%. A lot of this was fueled by tax credits, stimulus checks, and huge growth in China. And it seemed like Tesla had a lot of headwinds. With rising interest rates making financing vehicles more difficult, the operating margins continued to decline. You cannot have a stock go up that has declining operating margins. I rarely ever see that happen. So when operating margins were going from 20% down to 5%, of course Tesla stock was going to tread water for years during that time period. But now we see the trend reversal. I predict that if Tesla can get operating margins even halfway back up to where they were, around 15% or 16%, they'll surpass the amount of free cash flow they generated with 20% operating margins. The reason why is because they're delivering a lot more vehicles and they have a lot more revenue than they did back here. So Tesla does not need to have the same operating margins they had in 2022. They just need to keep moving most of the way there. One of the KPIs I think worth tracking for Tesla is the amount of vehicles they're producing and the amount of vehicles that are being delivered. Overall, there's not a lot of growth in the amount of models delivered or produced. But Elon Musk gave us reason to believe that this is going to improve. Here's what he said on the earnings call. I think probably people are wondering, well, what should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year? And to take a bit of risk here, I do want to give some rough estimate, which is I think it's 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year. Now he gives a disclaimer, there's no guarantees here, but he's predicting 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year. So even the question over the flat deliveries and production, we can see that we're projecting growth in the future, which is another check mark. The last thing I'll point out about Tesla stock is the energy and storage business. If we look at the revenue, and we just look at that segment alone, you can see that for a few quarters, it looked like it was tapering off, flattening out. And again, they somehow reignited growth in this part of the business. On a trailing basis, it's growing 43% year over year. The energy business is a jewel of Tesla. It's one of the better parts of the company. Overall, this was by far the strongest report that Tesla has given out over the past three years. And I think this sets the company up to go in the right direction. This is something Tesla investors desperately needed. They needed these metrics moving in the right direction and soon, and they're getting it. Valuation, of course, is a whole different concern. Tesla is a highly rated stock. It trades at a premium valuation, but fundamentally, it looks very strong right now. Now very soon after that great earnings report from Tesla, and the stock moving up 20%, the Wall Street Journal decided to drop a big hit piece on Elon Musk, the title of which is Elon Musk's secret conversations with Vladimir Putin. And right there, the Wall Street Journal knows what they're doing. They understand media. They know the effect this will have. The effect this will have is millions and millions of people will read the headline. They'll conclude all of these nefarious conclusions from the headline, and they will not read the article. The Wall Street Journal intentionally makes their articles very long and detailed. In many cases, they don't summarize the main points unless it's somewhere on page three or four of the article. Now you can say that they're being detailed and thorough with their reporting, but it also makes it difficult for the majority of people to actually know what are the key takeaways that went on here. What I got from this article is one of the more contrived efforts to attack Elon Musk. We can jump right to the most provocative parts of the article. This is really the heart of it. Putin had asked the billionaire to avoid activating his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan as a favor to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. This is according to two people that were familiar with it and briefed by the Wall Street Journal. And that is the most scandalous, the most provocative portion of this entire piece. One thing that's missing with this article is the acknowledgement that they have no evidence that Elon Musk listened to what he said, that he made any type of changes because of Putin's request. There's only the claim that Putin asked this. There's no evidence that Elon Musk changed anything he's doing because of Putin's request. In fact, there's a lot of reason to believe that Elon Musk did nothing different because of this request. Because Taiwan has their own rules over whether or not Starlink can fly over them. And so far, there's no evidence whatsoever that Elon Musk broke any of those rules. So from this scary, provocative headline that Elon Musk is doing something secret with Vladimir Putin, they even encouraged this thought by photoshopping Elon Musk's face halfway with Vladimir Putin's. We learned that there's no evidence Elon Musk did anything that Vladimir Putin asked. There's no evidence he changed his behavior. The only real claim here that's actually somewhat verified is that they had a conversation. And obviously, with elections being so close and Elon Musk being such a prominent endorser of Donald Trump, it's going to lead a lot of people to believe that part of this is politically motivated. Right now, the elections are a coin flip. They could go either way. When things get this close, when elections are this tense, it seems like a lot of journals and news outlets will post things with very spicy headlines to try to make a dent in things. And this is the same way that the co-founder of Palantir reads this article. So what's going on, Andrew, is you got to look at the background right now. Europe is panicking. The Harris camp is panicking. There's two weeks of the election and they are throwing stuff at the wall. And what's happened in the last couple of weeks, what's happened is there's amazing momentum against the Harris team. Right. So you have, you have, you know, told not to go into Israel. They kill the bad guys in Israel. They look really, really dumb telling them to stay out of Rafa where they got Senwar. Right. You got the Tabata tie who worked for Mali, who they brought in, is clearly seems to be leaking stuff that, you know, her father worked for the Iranian regime. They're, Europe right now, of course, really angry at Musk. They had to fire Thierry Breton, the commissioner who used to be a minister of the French government. People in the French government do not like Elon right now. He just shamed them. Just two days ago, it came out. They're trying to kill Twitter. So, so, so, so basically they have all this momentum against them and they're panicking and they're throwing stuff at the wall. And, and the last time we talked about Russia this close to an election, it was the intelligence community. You're working on a fake document that Hillary created. They spent three years of asking him for BS. So it's like, you have this context that you have to look at. Like I mentioned, most people reading through this are going to view it through a political lens because of the timing of the article and the lack of concrete evidence of any type of wrongdoing from Elon Musk. So we'll see where this article goes. Maybe they'll dig up more evidence and find actual wrongdoing and rules violated from Elon Musk. But so far with this article, to me, it seems like a lot to do about nothing. Now, finally, we're getting towards the holiday season. As we get towards the end of the year, Activision Blizzard typically releases one of their big franchise games. This time it's the Call of Duty series. This is one of the more tried and true branded series. It's going to sell a lot. This is the reason that Microsoft invested $75 billion into this company was for the franchise Call of Duty. It's by far their most big and profitable franchise. Now, one thing that Microsoft is doing is trying to change the behavior of its customers. Anytime you try to change the behavior of customers, that is a difficult challenge. Being able to pull that off shows a lot of strength and skill in navigating these type of challenges. Call of Duty, one of the most successful entertainment properties ever, became part of Microsoft portfolio and the Activision deal. The company decided to make its latest installment of the shooter series called Call of Duty Black Ops 6 available at launch for streaming or downloading via Game Pass for $19.99 a month. Now, this may not seem, again, like that big of a deal, but if you go on to any online gaming forum, if you go to Reddit, if you go to anywhere where people discuss buying this game, the consensus is very clear. People say, don't buy Call of Duty Black Ops 6. Just sign up for Game Pass. Why pay $70 upfront, not knowing if the game is really great or not, when you can try it out for $19 a month. There's going to be millions of people that sign up for Game Pass simply to try out Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and not pay that $70 upfront. Analysts are trying to figure out whether or not this strategy will prove successful. One of them says the big picture vision here is Netflix for video games, and I think it's a very viable option. I don't know if it will happen all at once, but Microsoft is in a good position to do that. Some analysts are very skeptical and negative on this type of subscription Game Pass system. They say the video game business is not suited for an all-you-can-eat model, at least not at the price that makes sense for publishers. I disagree with those analysts, and I think that Microsoft is well positioned to pull off this type of subscription model for AAA video games. The truth is that gamers are already used to paying for things on a subscription model. They pay for season passes. They pay for microtransactions. It's actually becoming more rare that a video game makes the majority of its money on the upfront sale. Most people have freemium games where they download the game for free and they purchase season passes, skins, and additional in-game purchases. In this case, Microsoft is simply just saying, buy this one pass and you'll have access to a ton of video games on a monthly basis. There's no guarantee that Microsoft will be able to pull this off, but they have a very good chance. That's going to be it for this episode. I hope you enjoyed. See you in the next one. Bye.\n"
