      "1. Developing and investing in green energy: Macquarage is committed to growing renewable energy capacity and has developed, constructed, operated, and financed over 50 GW of green energy projects around the world. They have invested $A2.3 billion into green energy projects in the past five years, including some that are no longer on their balance sheet but continue to generate green energy.\n",
      "2. Creating climate resilient infrastructure: Macquarie is focusing on climate resilience and adaptation by investing in climate-specific risk assessments, revised operating procedures, physical enhancements, industrial technologies, and training for its portfolio companies, properties, and farmland. They are also designing new infrastructure projects with climate resilience in mind to deal with extreme weather events and rising sea levels.\n",
      "3. Enabling the decarbonisation of customers, clients, and portfolio companies: Macquarie is increasing its efforts to help its customers, clients, and portfolio companies take action towards decarbonisation. They have developed financing and risk management solutions in areas such as batteries, renewable fuels, clean transportation, and carbon offsets to help businesses enhance their sustainability commitments.\n",
      "4. Aligning activities to net zero: Macquarie has made a commitment to align its business operations and financing activities with the objective of enabling and accelerating the world's pathway to net zero by 2050. They have established a dedicated cross-group Net Zero Program team to assess their lending and equity clients' climate footprint and are on track to release their first net zero plan by the end of 2022.\n",
